In this study we propose a novel method for feature extraction and pattern recognition of ictal EEG, based upon empirical mode decomposition (EMD) and support vector machine (SVM). First the EEG signal is decomposed into Intrinsic Mode Functions (IMFs) using EMD, and then the coefficient of variation and fluctuation index of IMFs are extracted as features. SVM is then used as the classifier for recognition of ictal EEG. The experimental results show that this algorithm can achieve the sensitivity of 97.00% and specificity of 96.25% for interictal and ictal EEGs, and the sensitivity of 98.00% and specificity of 99.40% for normal and ictal EEGs on Bonn data sets.

The performance of current patient-specific algorithms is satisfactory. However, due to significant variability of EEG data between patients, cross-subject seizure characterization and detection remains a challenging task. The purpose of this study is to propose and investigate a modified convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture based on separable depth-wise convolution for effective automatic cross-subject seizure detection. The architecture is conceived with a reduced number of trainable parameters to reduce the model complexity and storage requirements to easily deploy it in connected devices for real-time seizure detection.

Wang,Epileptic Seizure Detection in Long-Term EEG Recordings by Using Wavelet-Based Directed Transfer Function,IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering,,1558-2531,"Goal: The accurate automatic detection of epileptic seizures is very important in long-term electroencephalogram (EEG) recordings. In this study, the wavelet decomposition and the directed transfer function (DTF) algorithm were combined to present a novel wavelet-based directed transfer function (WDTF) method for the patient-specific seizure detection. Methods: First, five subbands were extracted from 19-channel EEG signals by using wavelet decomposition in a sliding window. Second, the information flow characteristics of five subbands and full frequency band of EEG signals were calculated by the DTF method. The intensity of the outflow information was then used to reduce the feature dimensionality. Finally, all features were combined to identify interictal and ictal EEG segments by the support vector machine classifier. Results: By using fivefold cross validation, the proposed method had achieved excellent performance with the average accuracy of 99.4%, the average selectivity of 91.1%, the average sensitivity of 92.1%, the average specificity of 99.5%, and the average detection rate of 95.8%. Conclusion: The WDTF method is able to enhance seizure detection results in long-term EEG recordings of focal epilepsy patients. Significance: This study may lead to the development of seizure detection system with high performance, thus reducing the workload of epileptologists and facilitating to take corresponding steps promptly after the seizure onset. The high-frequency activity in the epilepsy brain may be of great importance for investigating the pathological mechanism and treatment of seizure.",https://doi.org/10.1109/TBME.2018.2809798,10.1109/TBME.2018.2809798,,2018-11,28/03/2024 1:15,28/03/2024 1:15,,2591-2599,,11,65,,IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,<p>ASReview_relevant</p>,,,Brain modeling; directed transfer function; Electroencephalography; Epilepsy; Feature extraction; Long-term electroencephalogram (EEG); Monitoring; outflow information; seizure detection; Sensitivity; Transfer functions; wavelet decomposition,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Yes,,,,Include,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, EEG signals are complex, nonlinear, and dynamic, thus generating large amounts of data polluted by many artefacts, lowering the signal-to-noise ratio, and hampering expert interpretation. The traditional seizure-detection method of professional review of long-term EEG signals is an expensive, time-consuming, and challenging task. To reduce the complexity and cost of the task, researchers have developed several seizure-detection approaches, primarily focusing on classification systems and spectral feature extraction. While these methods can achieve high/optimal performances, the system may require retraining and following up with the feature extraction for each new patient, thus making it impractical for real-world applications. Herein, we present a straightforward manual/automated detection system based on the simple seizure feature amplification analysis to minimize these practical difficulties. Our algorithm (a simplified version is available as additional material), borrowing from the telecommunication discipline, treats the seizure as the carrier of information and tunes filters to this specific bandwidth, yielding a viable, computationally inexpensive solution. Manual tests gave 93% sensitivity and 96% specificity at a false detection rate of 0.04/h. Automated analyses showed 88% and 97% sensitivity and specificity, respectively. Moreover, our proposed method can accurately detect seizure locations within the brain. In summary, the proposed method has excellent potential, does not require training on new patient data, and can aid in the localization of seizure focus/origin. © 2022 by the authors.",https://doi.org/10.3390/s22218444,10.3390/s22218444,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85141581968&doi=10.3390%2fs22218444&partnerID=40&md5=bd52b76d4fc24a933ad88173430a62c6,2022,28/03/2024 1:15,28/03/2024 1:15,,,,21,22,,Sensors,,,,,,,,English,,,Scopus,,,,,"<p>ASReview_relevant</p>; <p>Export Date: 13 February 2024; Cited By: 1; Correspondence Address: N.

Joseph,Single feature-based non-convulsive epileptic seizure detection using multi-class SVM,"2013 International Conference on Emerging Trends in Communication, Control, Signal Processing and Computing Applications (C2SPCA)",,,"Epileptic seizures are abnormal, excessive, synchronous and unprovoked neural activity occuring in the brain affecting 2% of the world population. Epileptic patients mostly generates interictal EEG which on accurate detection provides vital information for epileptic seizure prediction. Nonconvulsive epilepsy, most commonly occuring epilepsy, results in continuous seizing of brain and the patient becomes unresponsive during the episode. This type of epileptic seizures show minimal symptoms and are often under-diagnosed resulting in late treatment. A multi level classification (epileptic, interictal and normal) providing interictal information in addition to normal and epileptic informations proves to be highly useful to Neurologists in the prediction and diagnosis of nonconvulsive epileptic seizures. An automated multilevel SVM based nonconvulsive epileptic seizure detection method utilizing a single feature vector (enabling fast classification) calculated from the fifth detail wavelet coefficients of the given EEG data is proposed here. Case study on different features like energy, mean energy, entropy, mean cross correlation, mean curve length, coefficient of variation, interquartile range and median absolute deviation yielded an optimum single feature. Energy, entropy, interquartile range and median absolute deviation were effective (above 95% accuracy) for the multi-level classification of EEG data with interquartile range being optimum feature with 99.96% accuracy and very low runtime of less than six seconds.",https://doi.org/10.1109/C2SPCA.2013.6749374,10.1109/C2SPCA.2013.6749374,,10/10/2013,28/03/2024 1:15,28/03/2024 1:15,,1-Jun,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,<p>ASReview_relevant</p>,,,Electroencephalography; Support vector machines; Feature extraction; Wavelet decomposition; Entropy; Wavelet transforms; Accuracy; Interquartile range; Multi-class support vector machine; Nonconvulsive epilepsy,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"2013 International Conference on Emerging Trends in Communication, Control, Signal Processing and Computing Applications (C2SPCA)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Yes,,,,Include,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Electroencephalograms (EEGs) record electrical activity in the brain and are used to detect epilepsy. Traditional EEG analysis methods for epileptic seizure detection are time-consuming, which has led to the recent proposal of several automated seizure detection frameworks. Feature extraction and classification are two important steps in this procedure. Feature extraction focuses on finding the informative features that could be used in the classification step for correct decision making; therefore, proposing some effective feature extraction techniques for seizure detection is of great significance. This paper introduces two novel feature extraction techniques: local centroid pattern (LCP) and one-dimensional local ternary pattern (1D-LTP) for seizure detection in EEG signal. Both the techniques are computationally simple and easy to implement. In both the techniques, the histograms are formed in the first step using the transformation code and then these histogram-based feature vectors are fed into a classifier in the second step. The performance of the proposed techniques was evaluated through 10-fold cross-validation tested on the benchmark dataset. Different machine learning classifiers were used for the classification. The experimental results show that LCP and 1D-LTP achieved the highest accuracy of 100% for the classification between normal and seizure EEG signals with the artificial neural network classifier. Nine different experimental cases have been tested. The results achieved for different experimental cases were higher than the results of some existing techniques in the literature. The experimental results indicate that LCP and 1D-LTP could be effective feature extraction techniques for seizure detection. © 2017, Taiwanese Society of Biomedical Engineering.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s40846-017-0286-5,10.1007/s40846-017-0286-5,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85045391940&doi=10.1007%2fs40846-017-0286-5&partnerID=40&md5=13a2a6542f05bb0e8e943952439aa425,2018,28/03/2024 1:15,28/03/2024 1:15,,222-235,,2,38,,J.

Methods: We used EEG data from 29 seizures of 18 temporal lobe epilepsy patients who underwent multiday video-scalp EEG monitoring as part of their presurgical evaluations. We segmented each data set into preictal and ictal phases, and identified spectral entropy, spectral energy, and signal energy as useful features for discriminating normal and seizure conditions. The performance of five different classifiers was analyzed using these features to design an automated detection system. Results: Among the five classifiers, decision tree, k-nearest neighbor, and support vector machine performed with sensitivity (specificity) of 79% (81%), 75% (85%), and 80% (86%), respectively. The other two, linear discriminant algorithm and Naive Bayes classifiers, performed with sensitivity (specificity) of 54% (94%), 47% (96%), respectively. Conclusions: The support vector machine–based seizure detection system showed better detection capability in terms of sensitivity and specificity measures as compared to linear discriminant algorithm, Naive Bayes, decision tree, and k-nearest neighbor classifiers. Conclusions: Our study shows that a generalized system to detect the electrical onset of seizures in temporal lobe epilepsy using scalp-recorded EEG is possible. If confirmed on a larger data set, our findings may have significant implications for the management of seizures, especially in patients with drug-resistant epilepsy.

In this present study, a novel feature selection scheme based on the discrete wavelet packet decomposition and cuckoo search algorithm (CSA) was proposed. The normal as well as epileptic EEG recordings were first decomposed into various frequency bands by means of wavelet packet decomposition, and subsequently, statistical features at all developed nodes in the wavelet packet decomposition tree were derived. Instead of using the complete set of the extracted features to construct a wavelet neural networks-based classifier, an optimal feature subset that maximizes the predictive competence of the classifier was selected by using the CSA. Experimental results on the publicly available benchmarks demonstrated that the proposed feature subset selection scheme achieved promising recognition accuracies of 98.43–100%, and the results were statistically significant using z-test with p value <0.0001. © 2017, Springer-Verlag London Ltd.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s10044-017-0642-7,10.1007/s10044-017-0642-7,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85026894087&doi=10.1007%2fs10044-017-0642-7&partnerID=40&md5=ca3ebb9419c2cbc8e5f493c2ed83516b,2018,28/03/2024 1:15,28/03/2024 1:15,,515-527,,2,21,,Pattern Anal.

Electroencephalography (EEG) measures the electrical activity of the brain and is widely used in epilepsy diagnosis, but it usually requires manual inspection, which can be hours long, by a neu-rologist. Several automatic systems have been proposed to detect epilepsy but still have some un-solved issues. In this study, we proposed a dynamic method using a deep learning model (Epileptic‐ Net) to detect an epileptic seizure. The proposed method is largely heterogeneous and comprised of the dense convolutional blocks (DCB), feature attention modules (FAM), residual blocks (RB), and hypercolumn technique (HT). Firstly, DCB is used to get the discriminative features from the EEG samples. Then, FAM extracts the essential features from the samples. After that, RB learns more vital parts as it entirely uses information in the convolutional layer. Finally, HT retains the efficient local features extracted from the layers situated at the different levels of the model. Its performance has been evaluated on the University of Bonn EEG dataset, divided into five distinct classes. The proposed Epileptic‐Net achieves the average accuracy of 99.95% in the two‐class classification, 99.98% in the three‐class classification, 99.96% in the four‐class classification, and 99.96% in classi-fying the complicated five‐class problem. Thus the proposed approach shows more competitive results than the existing model to detect epileptic seizures. We also hope that this method can support experts in achieving objective and reliable results, lowering the misdiagnosis rate, and assisting in decision‐making. © 2022 by the authors.

Its accurate detection is a challenge since sometimes patients do not experience any prior alert to identify a seizure. Electroencephalography (EEG) recordings are used for seizure detection, but these are usually of longer duration, and as a result, the behavior of the inherent data set is highly imbalanced. To detect seizures in such a scenario is a challenging task; using a typical classifier such as decision tree and decision forest can result in highly skewed class value (non-seizure), causing incorrect detection of epileptic patients. To solve this, a cost-sensitive learning method with a random forest was used. An algorithm that helps in seizure detection by penalizing the cost of a false negative concerning the duration of an EEG recording was proposed. The experimental results show that executing the classifier without penalty or inadequate penalties to the cost matrix is not a satisfactory solution. As a result, the algorithm provides up to 100% recall, which means all the seizure seconds are detected. The proposed method substantiates achieving higher actual seizure detection rates; the imposed penalty should be equal to the time duration of the EEG recordings (in seconds) for a patient. Hence, it can be potentially applied to the pre-consultation to the neurologist at the Outpatient Department for the actual seizure detection cases and refer them to the neurology department for further consultation. © 2020, Springer-Verlag France SAS, part of Springer Nature.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s12008-020-00715-3,10.1007/s12008-020-00715-3,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85093985615&doi=10.1007%2fs12008-020-00715-3&partnerID=40&md5=d2424f1461cbe622ec344431617e8a6d,2020,28/03/2024 1:15,28/03/2024 1:15,,1491-1509,,4,14,,Int.

It is extremely crucial to have accurate automatic pattern recognition and data mining techniques to detect the onset of seizures and inform care-givers to help the patients. EEG signals are the preferred biosignals for diagnosis of epileptic patients. Most of the existing pattern recognition techniques used in EEG analysis leverage the notion of supervised machine learning algorithms. Since seizure data are heavily under-represented, such techniques are not always practical particularly when the labeled data is not sufficiently available or when disease progression is rapid and the corresponding EEG footprint pattern will not be robust. Furthermore, EEG pattern change is highly individual dependent and requires experienced specialists to annotate the seizure and non-seizure events. In this work, we present an unsupervised technique to discriminate seizures and non-seizures events. We employ power spectral density of EEG signals in different frequency bands that are informative features to accurately cluster seizure and non-seizure events.

The performance of the 14 different combinations of two-class epilepsy detection is studied using naïve Bayes (NB) and k-nearest neighbor (k-NN) classifiers for the derived statistical features from DWT. It has been found that the NB classifier performs better and shows an accuracy of 100% for the individual and combined statistical features derived from the DWT values of normal eyes open and epileptic EEG data provided by the University of Bonn, Germany. It has been found that the computation time of NB classifier is lesser than k-NN to provide better accuracy.

In this research, we explore the ability of a newly-developed algorithm named scattering transform in seizure detection. The preprocessed signal is initially decomposed into scattering coefficients with various orders and scales employing scattering transform. Fuzzy entropy (FuzzyEn) and Log energy entropy (LogEn) of the sub-band coefficients are obtained to characterize the epileptic seizure signals. Then the joint features are fed into five classifiers including support vector machine (SVM), least squares-support vector machine (LS-SVM), genetic algorithm-support vector machine (GA-SVM), extreme learning machine (ELM) and probabilistic neural network (PNN) for the verification of the effectiveness of the proposed scheme. Finally, we not only compare the classification results and the time efficiency derived from different classifiers, but also explore the discrimination performance of the proposed methodology based on ten different classification tasks with great clinical significance. The prominent classification accuracy (ACC) of 99.87 %, 99.59 %, 99.58 %, 99.56 % and 99.80 % are achieved using the above five classifiers respectively. The average ACC and Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC) of 99.75 % and 0.99 are also yielded based on all tasks. Furthermore, the result of Kruskal-Wallis Test for the verification of statistical significance confirms the reliability of the proposal. The comparison with the latest state-of-the-art techniques indicates the superior performance of the proposal. A tradeoff between classification accuracy and time complexity of the proposed approach is accomplished in our work and the possibility for clinical application is also demonstrated. © 2019 Nalecz Institute of Biocybernetics and Biomedical Engineering of the Polish Academy of Sciences",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bbe.2019.11.002,10.1016/j.bbe.2019.11.002,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85076263913&doi=10.1016%2fj.bbe.2019.11.002&partnerID=40&md5=a279bdb94cec497c4431a28e2ad7c199,2020,28/03/2024 1:15,28/03/2024 1:15,,77-89,,1,40,,Biocybern.

We applied a nonlinear data-embedding technique based on stochastic neighbor distance metric to capture the relationships among data elements in high dimension and improve the accuracy of seizure detection. This proposed data embedding technique not only makes it possible to visualize data in two or three dimensions, but also tackles the inherent difficulties regarding high dimensional data classification such as time complexity and memory requirement.

Anew algorithm based on directed transfer function (DTF) method was proposed for epileptic seizure detection. First, the sliding window technique was used to segment electroencephalogram (EEG) recordings, and the cerebral functional connectivity was calculated by the DTF algorithm. Then, the total information outflow based on the DTF-derived connectivity was calculated by adding up the information flow from a single EEG channel to other channels. Finally, the information outflow was assigned as the features of support vector machine (SVM) classifier to discriminate interictal and ictal EEG segments. For 10 epilepsy patients, the proposed algorithm provided the mean correct rate of 98.45%, the mean selectivity of 64.43%, the mean sensitivity of 93.36%, the mean specificity of 98.42%, and the average detection rate of 95.89%. By applying the statistical analysis, the superiority of DTF-based method was statistically significant when compared with other algorithms in terms of five assessment criteria.

The EEGs of 42 patients with new-onset ES, 42 patients with PNES video recorded and 19 patients with CS all with normal interictal EEG on visual inspection, were analyzed in the study; none of them was taking psychotropic drugs before registration.

A neurological disorder of any human being can be analyzed using EEG (Electroencephalography) signal from the electrode’s output. Epilepsy (spontaneous recurrent seizure) detection is usually carried out by the physicians using a visual scanning of the signals produced by EEG, which is onerous and may be inaccurate. EEG signal is often used to determine epilepsy, for its merits, such as non-invasive, portable, and economical, can exhibit superior temporal tenacity. This paper surveys the existing artifact removal methods. It puts a new-fangled mode forward to confiscate artifacts and hauls informative derived values from EEG to automate Epilepsy detection. The automated Epilepsy detection has to precisely indicate and detect the neural abnormality of the brain. This indication and detection process necessitates a proficient approach for the prompt removal of artifacts of the EEG signals. An effective artifact removal of EEG signals can alone enable the useful features of the original signals for further processing. Once the original signals excluding the noise is obtained, a delicate strategy for extracting the features of the signals, becomes mandatory in order to accomplish robust classification of the signal. Then an expert classification technique is implemented to aid the automated analysis process to correctly distinguish the EEG signal features. © 2022, Tech Science Press.

This is because the diversity and the evolution of the epileptic seizures make it very difficult in detecting and identifying the undergoing disease. Fortunately, the determinism and nonlinearity in a time series could characterize the state changes. Literature review indicates that the Delay Vector Variance (DVV) could examine the nonlinearity to gain insight into the EEG signals but very limited work has been done to address the quantitative DVV approach. Hence, the outcomes of the quantitative DVV should be evaluated to detect the epileptic seizures. OBJECTIVE: To develop a new epileptic seizure detection method based on quantitative DVV. METHODS: This new epileptic seizure detection method employed an improved delay vector variance (IDVV) to extract the nonlinearity value as a distinct feature. Then a multi-kernel functions strategy was proposed in the extreme learning machine (ELM) network to provide precise disease detection and prediction. RESULTS: The nonlinearity is more sensitive than the energy and entropy. 87.5% overall accuracy of recognition and 75.0% overall accuracy of forecasting were achieved. CONCLUSIONS: The proposed IDVV and multi-kernel ELM based method was feasible and effective for epileptic EEG detection. Hence, the newly proposed method has importance for practical applications. © IOS Press and the authors.

Epilepsy is a neurological disorder which is an unexpected electrical disturbance of the brain. Due to which nerve cell activity in the brain becomes disrupted, causes people to have a “Seizure”. Now a day researchers are working and focusing on an automatic analysis of EEG signal to classify the Epilepsy. The EEG signal recording system generate very lengthy data. So, classification of epilepsy seizure requires a time-consuming process. This paper proposes SVM (Support Vector Machine) based automatic epilepsy seizure classification system that uses ApEn (Approximation Entropy). ApEn is reducing the patient data size without any loss of patient data so; we can easily classify the epilepsy seizure. ApEn is statistical parameters that measure the current amplitude value of an EEG signal based on its previous amplitude value. In this paper, we measure sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy using SVM classifier.

This paper proposes a novel automatic epileptic EEG detection method based on convolutional neural network (CNN) with two innovative improvements and treats this task as a big data classification issue. Due to that CNN could extract and learn features automatically, the multi-channels time-series EEG recordings extracted by a sliding window are fed into the CNN model. Firstly, a 12-layers CNN is designed as the baseline epileptic EEG classification model. Afterward, the merger of the increasing and decreasing sequences (MIDS) is introduced to highlight the characteristic of waveforms. Then, a data augmentation method, Wasserstein Generative Adversarial Nets (WGANs), increases the sample diversity as well as EEG information. In this experiment, the recordings are from CHB-MIT Scalp EEG database, and the patient-cross performance with the train set from other patients and test set from the withheld patient is evaluated. The epileptic EEG classification results show that the original CNN achieves 70.68% sensitivity and 92.30% specificity, while CNN with MIDS and data augmentation yield 74.08% sensitivity, 92.46% specificity and 72.11% sensitivity, 95.89% specificity respectively. These two novel improvements both increased automatic epileptic EEG classification performance.

Owing to these natures, manual interpretation and detection of epileptic seizure is not reliable and efficient process. Hence, this study is intended to develop a new computer-aided detection system that can automatically and efficiently identify epileptic seizure from huge amount EEG data. In this study, Hermite Transform is introduced for extracting discriminating information from EEG data for the detection of epileptic seizure. The analysis is performed in three stages: EEG signal transformation into a new form by Hermite Transform; computation of three types of features, namely permutation entropy, histogram feature and statistical feature; and classification of obtained features by least square support vector machine. The classification outcomes reveal the presence of epileptic seizure. The proposed method is evaluated on a benchmark Epileptic EEG database (Bonn University data) and the performance of this method is compared with several state-of-art algorithms for the same database. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed scheme has the ability to efficiently detect epileptic seizure from EEG data outperforming competing techniques in terms of overall classification accuracy. © The Institution of Engineering and Technology 2018.",https://doi.org/10.1049/iet-smt.2018.5358,10.1049/iet-smt.2018.5358,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85059983605&doi=10.1049%2fiet-smt.2018.5358&partnerID=40&md5=428e5e37b4d5918ce38018b8bf23a4cc,2019,28/03/2024 1:15,28/03/2024 1:15,,35-41,,1,13,,IET Sci.

There is an urgent demand for an automatic epilepsy detection system using electroencephalography (EEG) for clinical application. In this paper, the EEG signal is divided into short time frames. Discrete wavelet transform is used to decompose each frame into a number of subbands. Different entropies as well as a group of features with which to characterize the spike events are extracted from each subband signal of an EEG frame. The features extracted from individual subbands are concatenated, yielding a high-dimensional feature vector. A discriminative subset of features is selected from the feature vector using a graph eigen decomposition (GED)-based approach. Thus, the reduced number of features obtained is effective for differentiating the underlying characteristics of EEG signals that indicate seizure events and those that indicate nonseizure events. The GED method ranks the features according to their contribution to correct classification. The selected features are used to classify seizure and nonseizure EEG signals using a feedforward neural network (FfNN). The performance of the proposed method is evaluated by conducting various experiments with a standard dataset obtained from the University of Bonn. The experimental results show that the proposed seizure-detection scheme achieves a classification accuracy of 99.55%, which is higher than that of state-of-the-art methods. The efficiency of FfNN is compared with linear discriminant analysis and support vector machine classifiers, which have classification accuracies of 98.72% and 99.39%, respectively. Hence, the proposed method is confirmed as a potential marker for EEG-based seizure detection. © 2020 by the authors.

However, proper diagnosis of epilepsy requires the detection and analysis of epileptic seizures for a long period of time. Manual monitoring of long term EEG is tedious and costly. Therefore, a reliable automated seizure detection system is desirable. Most current state-of-the-art methods use hand crafted feature extraction and simple classification techniques, which often leads to sub-par performance due to lack of generalizability across patient dataset. Consequently, this work introduces novel deep recurrent neural network (DRNN) architecture to perform automated patient specific seizure detection using scalp EEG. We further propose a unique mapping of seizure EEG signal for efficient processing with the DRNN. This mapping allows the proposed deep architecture to simultaneously learn both temporal and spatial features of raw seizure EEG respectively. The proposed DRNN architecture is tested with long term patient specific scalp EEG data of 5 subjects with approximately 34 hours of EEG extracted from a publically available dataset. Overall, the proposed network successfully detects 100% of total seizure events with an average detection delay of ~7.0 sec. The results demonstrate superior performance to that of the current state-of-art seizure detection methods. The proposed DRNN architecture also obtains a runtime of approximately 30ms for 1 sec segment of 18 channel EEG.

Then, EWT is used to decompose EEG signals into narrow sub-band signals and HMS of these sub-band signals have been computed. For a synthetically generated multi-component frequency modulated signal, the EWT based HMS is compared with the conventional Fourier spectrum obtained using fast Fourier transform (FFT) algorithm. Three features have been extracted from these HMSs which belong to distinct oscillatory levels of the EEG signals and probability (p) value based feature ranking is performed.

To realize the detection and classification of epileptic seizure, this paper proposes a method based on the combination of signal decomposition and statistical methods. First, the algorithm of variational mode decomposition (VMD) is applied to extract the components of intrinsic mode functions (IMFs) by decomposing the EEG signals. Then the statistical method is utilized to calculate the eight features of maximum, minimum, average, variance, skewness, kurtosis, coefficient of variation and volatility index for each extracted IMF component. Finally, the best combinations of extracted features are fed into the non-linear twin support vector machine (NLTWSVM) to classify the epileptic signals.

It is known that seizure processes are nonlinear and non-stationary, discriminating between rhythmic discharges and dynamic change is a challenging task in EEG-based seizure detection. In this paper, a new time-varying (TV) modeling framework, based on an autoregressive (AR) model structure, is proposed to characterize and analyze EEG signals. The TV parameters of the AR model are approximated through a multi-wavelet basis function expansion (MWBF) approach. An effective ultra-regularized orthogonal forward regression (UROFR) algorithm is employed to significantly reduce and refine the resulting expanded model. Given a time-varying process, the proposed TVAR–MWBF–UROFR method can generate a parsimonious TVAR model, based on which a high-resolution power spectrum density (PSD) estimation can be obtained. Informative features are then defined and extracted from the PSD estimation. The TVAR–MWBF–UROFR method is applied to a number of real EEG datasets; features obtained from these datasets are then used for seizure detection and classification. To make the results more accurate and reliable, a PCA algorithm is adopted to select the optimal feature subset, and a Bayesian optimization technique based on the Gaussian process is performed to determine the coefficients associated with each of the classifiers. The performance of the proposed method is tested on two benchmark datasets, and the experimental results indicate that TVAR–MWBF–UROFR outperforms the compared state-of-the-art classifiers in terms of accuracy, specificity, sensitivity and robustness. © 2020, Springer-Verlag London Ltd., part of Springer Nature.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s00521-020-05330-7,10.1007/s00521-020-05330-7,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85091143679&doi=10.1007%2fs00521-020-05330-7&partnerID=40&md5=035092dcbc1c74721bcc9a63e0a5a02a,2021,28/03/2024 1:15,28/03/2024 1:15,,5525-5541,,11,33,,Neural Comput.

This decreases the time it takes to identify seizures and, as a result, improves seizure activity prediction. We propose a computer-aided method to detect the pre-ictal and ictal activity from a multichannel EEG signal. Three pre-processing techniques that are applied to EEG time-domain signals to generate an image database are proposed here. This image database is given as input to the machine learning algorithm for classification. Conversion of a time domain EEG signal to an image is accomplished by extracting EEG signal features such as correlation coefficient, short-time Fourier transform (spectrogram), and mutual information.

We tested the method on EEG data of 24 patients from the CHB-MIT public dataset. The procedure starts by decomposing the EEG data from each channel into different frequency bands using the empirical mode decomposition (EMD) or the discrete wavelet transform (DWT), and then for each sub-band four features are extracted; two energy values and two fractal dimension values. The obtained feature vectors are then iteratively tested for solving two unconstrained objectives by NSGA-II or NSGA-III; to maximize classification accuracy and to reduce the number of EEG channels required for epileptic seizure classification. Our results have shown accuracies of up to 1.00 with only one EEG channel. Interestingly, when using all the EEG channels available, lower accuracies were achieved compared to the case when EEG channels were selected by NSGA-II or NSGA-III; i.e., in patient 19 we obtained an accuracy of 0.95 using all the channels and 0.975 using only two channels selected by NSGA-III.

Currently, the epilepsy is mainly detected by clinicians based on visual observation of EEG recordings, which is generally time consuming and sensitive to bias. This paper presents a novel automatic seizure detection method based on the multiscale radial basis function (MRBF) networks and the Fisher vector (FV) encoding. Specifically, the MRBF networks are first used to obtain high-resolution time-frequency (TF) images for feature extraction, where both a modified particle swarm optimization (MPSO) method and an orthogonal least squares (OLS) algorithm are implemented to determine optimal scales and detect a parsimonious model structure. Gray level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM) texture descriptors and the FV, which contribute to high-dimensional vectors, are then adopted to achieve discriminative features based on five frequency subbands of clinical interests from TF images. Furthermore, the dimensionality of the original feature space can be effectively reduced by the t-test statistical tool before feeding compact features into the SVM classifier for seizure detection. Finally, the classification performance of the proposed method is evaluated by using two widely used EEG database, and is observed to provide good classification accuracy on both datasets.

Feature extraction of EEG signals determines the performance of the whole recognition system. In this paper, a novel method using the local binary pattern (LBP) based on the wavelet transform (WT) is proposed to characterize the behavior of EEG activities. First, the WT is employed for time-frequency decomposition of EEG signals. After that, the ""uniform"" LBP operator is carried out on the wavelet-based time-frequency representation. And the generated histogram is regarded as EEG feature vector for the quantification of the textural information of its wavelet coefficients. The LBP features coupled with the support vector machine (SVM) classifier can yield the satisfactory recognition accuracies of 98.88% for interictal and ictal EEG classification and 98.92% for normal, interictal and ictal EEG classification on the publicly available EEG dataset. Moreover, the numerical results on another large size EEG dataset demonstrate that the proposed method can also effectively detect seizure events from multi-channel raw EEG data.

The analysis of electroencephalogram (EEG) signals can lead to the detection of epileptic seizures. But due to immensely non-linear and non-stationary nature of EEG, it is very tedious to inspect and interpret these signals visually. Therefore, methods such as discrete wavelet transform (DWT), and non-linear features are used for automated detection of epilepsy from EEG signals. These methods represent discontinuities, repeated patterns and complexities in EEG signals much effectively and have very high discrimination ability to differentiate EEG segments into normal, interictal and ictal classes. In this work, we formed various feature sets using combination of DWT statistical features and non-linear features such as entropies and fractal dimension.

Therefore, computer-aided detection provides an asset to the neurophysiologist in interpreting the EEG. This paper introduces a novel approach to recognize and classify the epileptic seizure and seizure-free EEG signals automatically by an intelligent computer-aided method. Moreover, the prediction of the preictal phase of the epilepsy is proposed to assist the neurophysiologist in the clinic. The proposed method presents two perspectives for the EEG signal processing to detect and classify the seizures and seizure-free signals. The first perspectives consider the EEG signal as a nonlinear time series. A tunable Q-wavelet is applied to decompose the signal into smaller segments called subbands. Then a chaotic, statistical, and power spectrum features sets are extracted from each subband. The second perspectives process the EEG signal as an image; hence the gray-level co-occurrence matrix is determined from the image to obtain the textures of contrast, correlation, energy, and homogeneity. Due to a large number of features obtained, a feature selection algorithm based on firefly optimization was applied. The firefly optimization reduces the original set of features and generates a reduced compact set. A random forest classifier is trained for the classification and prediction of the seizures and seizure-free signals. Afterward, a dataset from the University of Bonn, Germany, is used for benchmarking and evaluation. The proposed approach provided a significant result compared with other recent work regarding accuracy, recall, specificity, F-measure, and Matthew's correlation coefficient. © 2018 Ahmed I.

An efficient tool for signal irregularity analysis is Sample Entropy (SampEn). In this context, our paper was elaborated. We used SampEn to design a Machine Learning model for brain state detection based on EEG signals, which allows to differentiate between healthy (H) subjects, epileptic subjects during seizures free intervals (E) and epileptic subjects during seizures (S). Two main novelties are presented in our paper. The first one is related to the outline of the designed machine learning model, signal derivatives are determined as preprocessing step, then extracted features are SampEn and Standard Deviation (STD) from EEG signals and its first and second derivatives. These features are firstly used to train a K-Nearest Neighbor classifier (KNN) and yield high accuracy. After that, we select the most relevant features and we design our proposed classifier that provides better accuracy. The second one is related to the performance of our model to overcome some crucial purposes.

Detection of epileptic attack is commonly carried out by viewing and analysing long-duration multi-channel EEG records. To counter this time-consuming process, a hybrid Local Binary Pattern-Wavelet based approach, classifying EEG in epileptic patients, is adopted in this research. Epilepsy is characterized by multiple ictal patterns in the form of synchronous epileptiform discharge transients. This work attempts to classify seizure from normal EEG recordings using the low-frequency activity. In order to perform this classification, the EEG signal is filtered and then transformed using Local Binary Pattern (LBP) into a new signal. Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) is employed to decompose the obtained signal. Wavelet coefficients are calculated to 5 levels of decomposition. A combination of univariate and bivariate features forms the feature set for seizure detection. This feature set extracted from low-frequency band coefficients helps in bringing out the dispersion, symmetry, and peakedness present in the EEG signal. A novel LBP based Spatio-temporal analysis of the continuous EEG signal for epilepsy detection is carried out on 105 seizures from 14 randomly selected subjects of CHB-MIT EEG database. A sensitivity of 100% is achieved on the CHB-MIT database while long term EEG is being tested with Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) classifier. The algorithm works well to obtain a false detection rate (FP/Hour) of 0.59.

Conventionally, neurologists scrutinize these EEG signals to identify neurological abnormalities such as epilepsy. Such a way of observation is too time-consuming and requires proficiency. Therefore, a computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) system is needed to discriminate the class of these EEG signals automatically. This paper employs long short-term memory (LSTM) for the analysis of EEG signals. Herein, the LSTM model having only three layers is presented. This model achieved 98.5% accuracy to differentiate between non-seizures and seizures only in 30 epochs.

Yet few, if any, of these methods are used in clinical practice because they fail to generalize across different patient populations. We present three simple Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architectures for seizure detection that are capable of generalizing across sites. The convolutional layers automatically learn robust and discriminative correlations directly from both the raw multichannel scalp electroencephalography (EEG) signal and its short-time spectral representation. The models are trained on the publicly available Children's Hospital of Boston (CHB) data set in a leave-one-patient-out cross validation strategy. The trained model is then tested on a data set recorded at the University of Wisconsin (UW).

These methods are often patient‐specific and require high accuracy in detecting seizures but also very low false‐positive rates. The aim of this study is to evaluate the performance of a seizure detection method using EEG signals by investigating its performance in correctly identifying seizures and in minimizing false alarms and to determine if it is generalizable to different patients. Methods: We tested the method on about two hours of preictal/ictal and about ten hours of interictal EEG recordings of one patient from the Freiburg Seizure Prediction EEG database using machine learning techniques for data mining. Then, we tested the obtained model on six other patients of the same data-base. Results: The method achieved very high performance in detecting seizures (close to 100% of correctly classified positive elements) with a very low false‐positive rate when tested on one patient. Furthermore, the model portability or transfer analysis revealed that the method achieved good performance in one out of six patients from the same dataset. Conclusions: This result suggests a strategy to discover clusters of similar patients, for which it would be possible to train a general-purpose model for seizure detection. © 2022 by the authors.

Several studies have approached the classification and prediction of seizures by using electroencephalographic data and machine learning techniques. A large diversity of features has been extracted from electroencephalograms to perform classification tasks; therefore, it is important to use feature selection methods to select those that leverage pattern recognition. In this study, the performance of a set of feature selection methods was compared across different classification models; the classification task consisted of the detection of ictal activity from the CHB-MIT and Siena Scalp EEG databases. The comparison was implemented for different feature sets and the number of features. Furthermore, the similarity between selected feature subsets across classification models was evaluated. The best F1-score (0.90) was reported by the K-nearest neighbor along with the CHB-MIT dataset. Results showed that none of the feature selection methods clearly outperformed the rest of the methods, as the performance was notably affected by the classifier, dataset, and feature set.

Since electroencephalogram (EEG) is a harmless and noninvasive detection method, it plays an important role in the detection of neurological diseases. However, the process of analyzing EEG to detect neurological diseases is often difficult because the brain electrical signals are random, non-stationary and nonlinear. Objective: In order to overcome such difficulty, this study aims to develop a new computer-aided scheme for automatic epileptic seizure detection in EEGs based on multi-fractal detrended fluctuation analysis (MF-DFA) and support vector machine (SVM). Methods: New scheme first extracts features from EEG by MF-DFA during the first stage. Then, the scheme applies a genetic algorithm (GA) to calculate parameters used in SVM and classify the training data according to the selected features using SVM. Finally, the trained SVM classifier is exploited to detect neurological diseases. The algorithm utilizes MLlib from library of SPARK and runs on cloud platform. Results: Applying to a public dataset for experiment, the study results show that the new feature extraction method and scheme can detect signals with less features and the accuracy of the classification reached up to 99%. Conclusions: MF-DFA is a promising approach to extract features for analyzing EEG, because of its simple algorithm procedure and less parameters. The features obtained by MF-DFA can represent samples as well as traditional wavelet transform and Lyapunov exponents. GA can always find useful parameters for SVM with enough execution time. The results illustrate that the classification model can achieve comparable accuracy, which means that it is effective in epileptic seizure detection.  © 2017 IOS Press and the authors.

Electroencephalogram (EEG) is a widely used technique for monitoring the brain activity and widely popular for seizure region detection. It is performed before surgery and also to predict seizure at the time operation which is useful in neuro stimulation device. But in most of cases visual examination is done by neurologist in order to detect and classify patterns of the disease but this requires a lot of pre-domain knowledge and experience. This all in turns put a pressure on neurosurgeons and leads to time wastage and also reduce their accuracy and efficiency.

The proposed method consists of four main steps. Firstly, in order to investigate which method is most suitable to decompose the EEG signals into frequency bands, we implement separately a fast Fourier transform (FFT) or discrete wavelet transform (DWT). Secondly, each band is partitioned into k windows and a set of statistical features are extracted from each window. Thirdly, the InfoGain is used to rank the extracted features and the most important ones are selected. Lastly, these features are forwarded to a least square support vector machine (LS-SVM) classifier to classify the EEG. This scheme is implemented and tested on a benchmark EEG database and also compared with other existing methods, based on some performance evaluation measures. The experimental results show that the proposed FFT combined with InfoGain method can generate better performance than the DWT method. This method achieves 100% accuracy for five different pairs: healthy people with eyes open (z) versus epileptic patients with activity seizures (s); healthy people with eyes closed (o) versus s; epileptic patients with free seizures (n) versus s; patients with free seizures epileptic (f) versus s; and z versus o. The accuracies obtained for two other pairs, (o vs. n) and (z vs. f), are 95.62 and 88.32%, respectively. These two pairs have more similarities with each other, leading to a lower level of accuracy. The proposed approach outperforms six other reported methods and achieves an 11.9% improvement. Finally, it can be concluded that the proposed FFT combined with InfoGain method has the capacity to detect epileptic seizures in EEG most effectively. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s00500-018-3487-0,10.1007/s00500-018-3487-0,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85053215213&doi=10.1007%2fs00500-018-3487-0&partnerID=40&md5=1a05152e9435feff2e027bfa549f9314,2019,28/03/2024 1:15,28/03/2024 1:15,,227-239,,1,23,,Soft Comput.,,,,,,,,English,,,Scopus,,,,,"<p>ASReview_prior</p>; <p>ASReview_relevant</p>; <p>Export Date: 13 February 2024; Cited By: 43; Correspondence Address: H.R.

Recent deep learning models fail to fully consider both spectral and temporal domain representations simultaneously, which may lead to omitting the nonstationary or nonlinear property in epileptic EEGs and further produce a suboptimal recognition performance consequently. In this paper, an end-to-end EEG seizure detection framework is proposed by using a novel channel-embedding spectral-temporal squeeze-and-excitation network (CE-stSENet) with a maximum mean discrepancy-based information maximizing loss. Specifically, the CE-stSENet firstly integrates both multi-level spectral and multi-scale temporal analysis simultaneously. Hierarchical multi-domain representations are then captured in a unified manner with a variant of squeeze-and-excitation block. The classification net is finally implemented for epileptic EEG recognition based on features extracted in previous subnetworks. Particularly, to address the fact that the scarcity of seizure events results in finite data distribution and the severe overfitting problem in seizure detection, the CE-stSENet is coordinated with a maximum mean discrepancy-based information maximizing loss for mitigating the overfitting problem. Competitive experimental results on three EEG datasets against the state-of-the-art methods demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework in recognizing epileptic EEGs, indicating its powerful capability in the automatic seizure detection.",https://doi.org/10.1109/TNSRE.2020.2973434,10.1109/TNSRE.2020.2973434,,2020-04,28/03/2024 1:15,28/03/2024 1:15,,782-794,,4,28,,IEEE Transactions on Neural Systems and Rehabilitation Engineering,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,<p>ASReview_relevant</p>,,,EEG; Deep learning; Electroencephalography; deep learning; Convolution; Feature extraction; seizure detection; Brain modeling; maximum mean discrepancy; multi-domain feature extraction; Rhythm; Spectral analysis; squeeze & excitation,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Yes,,,,Include,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Three correlogram spectrums for 3 lags are computed for these rhythms. The extracted features of these spectrums have been combined by Hidden Markov Model (HMM) as a fusion method. The lag values are optimized using a hybrid approach based on Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) neural network and Genetic Algorithm (GA) with implementing the Hill-Climbing (HC) search technique. The final feature vector is obtained with optimal lags and optimized HMM feature fusion. This scenario for feature extraction and fusion is called Lagged Correlogram Patterns (LCP) algorithm. Meanwhile, the spectral entropy as a frequency model of signal is estimated. The maximum value of averaged spectrum on all windows has been considered as a feature.

In VMD, the number of decomposed modes K and the penalty coefficient α are selected empirically based on experience and observation which impacts its adaptability. To overcome this difficulty, we have proposed a novel method based on kurtosis to select K and α automatically for VMD decomposition of EEG signals. Primarily, the five sets of EEG data obtained from Bonn University database are decomposed into bandlimited intrinsic mode functions (BIMFs) using VMD with parameters K and α selected using the proposed kurtosis method, then amplitude modulation bandwidth (AMBω), frequency modulation bandwidth (FMBω) and spectral features of VMD decomposed BIMFs are evaluated. The significant features are obtained using Kruskal-Wallis test and fed to four different classifiers including Decision Tree (DT), K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN), Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Random Forest (RF) for five clinically relevant classification cases. Experimental results show that our presented work deals efficiently with all the five classification cases and accuracies greater than or equal to 98.7% have been achieved using RF classifier. Finally, in comparison with related works, our proposed seizure detection scheme performs better with higher accuracies in all the five cases. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bspc.2020.102255,10.1016/j.bspc.2020.102255,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85096868881&doi=10.1016%2fj.bspc.2020.102255&partnerID=40&md5=424d7287d39fe0b183e23a481eae708f,2021,28/03/2024 1:15,28/03/2024 1:15,,,,,64,,Biomed.

Duncan,Unsupervised Multivariate Time-Series Transformers for Seizure Identification on EEG,2022 21st IEEE International Conference on Machine Learning and Applications (ICMLA),,,"Epilepsy is one of the most common neurological disorders, typically observed via seizure episodes. Epileptic seizures are commonly monitored through electroencephalogram (EEG) recordings due to their routine and low expense collection. The stochastic nature of EEG makes seizure identification via manual inspections performed by highly-trained experts a tedious endeavor, motivating the use of automated identification. The literature on automated identification focuses mostly on supervised learning methods requiring expert labels of EEG segments that contain seizures, which are difficult to obtain. Motivated by these observations, we pose seizure identification as an unsupervised anomaly detection problem. To this end, we employ the first unsupervised transformer-based model for seizure identification on raw EEG. We train an autoencoder involving a transformer encoder via an unsupervised loss function, incorporating a novel masking strategy uniquely designed for multivariate time-series data such as EEG. Training employs EEG recordings that do not contain any seizures, while seizures are identified with respect to reconstruction errors at inference time. We evaluate our method on three publicly available benchmark EEG datasets for distinguishing seizure vs. non-seizure windows. Our method leads to significantly better seizure identification performance than supervised learning counterparts, by up to 16% recall, 9% accuracy, and 9% Area under the Receiver Operating Characteristics Curve (AUC), establishing particular benefits on highly imbalanced data. Through accurate seizure identification, our method could facilitate widely accessible and early detection of epilepsy development, without needing expensive label collection or manual feature extraction.",https://doi.org/10.1109/ICMLA55696.2022.00208,10.1109/ICMLA55696.2022.00208,,12/12/2022,28/03/2024 1:15,28/03/2024 1:15,,1304-1311,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,<p>ASReview_relevant</p>,,,EEG; Training; Epilepsy; Inspection; Seizure; Manuals; Transformers; Stochastic processes; Supervised learning; Time-series Transformer; Unsupervised Learning,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2022 21st IEEE International Conference on Machine Learning and Applications (ICMLA),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Yes,,,,Include,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This has been blamed on the scarcity of high-quality training data, which leads to models that generalize poorly. There is consequently interest in methods to improve the quality and quantity of training data for ESDs. This study used a domain generalization approach to combine data from two different datasets for training an ESD, which was thereafter tested on a third dataset. A subspace of the CHB-MIT and TUSZ scalp EEG seizure datasets was extracted using transfer component analysis, based on a reproducing kernel Hilbert space approach. We then used the Azimuthal Equidistant Projection to transform 3D electrode coordinates into 2D space, followed by interpolation using the Clough–Tocher technique to generate 16x16 rasters. We thereafter generated feature vectors, each of which was a sequence of 17 ten-layer 16x16 raster arrays. The vectors were used to train a recurrent-convolutional neural network. The network had a 128-unit long short-term memory layer with inputs from 17 parallel networks each with three stacks of convolutional layers. Testing was based on a private 26-subject dataset, combined with randomly selected subsets of the CHB-MIT and TUSZ datasets. A combined sensitivity of 74.5% was achieved, along with a false positive per hour rate of 0.84, and a latency of 2.32 s. Detection sensitivity on the private dataset was 72.5%.

For the decomposition of EEG, Hilbert vibration decomposition (HVD) has been employed. In this work, four brain rhythms – delta, theta, alpha, and beta have been utilized to obtain the mono-components. Certainly, the data-driven CNN model is most efficient for 2D image processing and recognition. Therefore, 2D images have been generated from one-dimensional (1D) decomposed mono-components by employing continuous wavelet transform (CWT). Next, simultaneous multiple input images in parallel have been directly fed into the CNN pipeline for feature extraction and classification. For evaluation, the EEG dataset provided by the Bonn University has been taken into consideration. Further, a 5-fold cross-validation technique has been applied to obtain generalized and robust classification performance. The average classification accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity reached up to 98.6%, 97.2%, and 100% respectively.

In previous works, several machine learning-based strategies were introduced to investigate and interpret EEG signals for the purpose of their accurate classification. However, non-linear and non-stationary characteristics of EEG signals make it complicated to get complete information about these dynamic biomedical signals. In order to address this issue, this paper focuses on extracting the most discriminating and distinguishing features of seizure EEG recordings to develop an approach that employs both fuzzy-based and traditional machine learning algorithms for epileptic seizure detection. The proposed framework classifies unknown EEG signal segments into ictal and interictal classes.

Traditional methods based on manual approaches applied in seizure detection in electroencephalograms (EEG) have drawbacks (e.g., time constraint, lack of effective feature identification relative to disease symptoms and susceptibility to human errors) that can lead to inadequate treatment options. Designing an automated expert system to detect epileptic seizures can proactively support a neurologist's effort to improve authenticity, speed and accuracy of detecting signs of a seizure. We propose a novel two-phase EEG classification technique to detect seizures from EEG by employing covariance matrix coupled with Adaptive Boosting Least Square-Support Vector Machine (i.e., AdaBoost LS-SVM) framework. In first phase, the covariance matrix is employed as a dimensionality reduction tool with feature extraction applied to analyse epileptic patients’ EEG records. Initially, each single EEG channel is partitioned into respective k segment with m clusters. Subsequently, covariance matrix is adopted with eigenvalues of each cluster extracted and tested through statistical metrics to identify the most representative, optimally classified features. In the second phase, a robust classifier (i.e., AB-LS-SVM) is proposed to resolve issues of unbalanced data, to detect epileptic events, yielding a high classification accuracy compared to its competing counterparts. The results demonstrates that AB-LS-SVM (optimised by a covariance matrix) is able to achieve satisfactory results (>99% accuracy) for eleven prominent features in EEG signals. The results are compared with state-of-art algorithms (i.e., k-means, SVM, k-nearest neighbour, Random Forest) on identical databases, demonstrating the capability of AB-LS-SVM method as a promising diagnostic tool and its practicality for implementation in seizure detection. The study avers that the proposed approach can aid clinicians in diagnosis or interventions to treat epileptic disease, including a potential use in expert systems where EEG needs to be classified through pattern recognition. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eswa.2020.113676,10.1016/j.eswa.2020.113676,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85087525782&doi=10.1016%2fj.eswa.2020.113676&partnerID=40&md5=05f368b8b0a7dc93e026b916e8f5b159,2020,28/03/2024 1:15,28/03/2024 1:15,,,,,161,,Expert Sys Appl,,,,,,,,English,,,Scopus,,,,,"<p>ASReview_relevant</p>; <p>Export Date: 13 February 2024; Cited By: 61; Correspondence Address: H.

And demodulation analysis (DA) was investigated to reveal the subtle envelope information from the sub-bands. All obtained coefficients were then used to calculate LDN features, scale parameter (σ) and shape parameter (μ), which were fed to a random forest classifier (RFC) for classification. Besides, some experiments have been conducted to evaluate the performance of proposed model in the consideration of various wavelet functions as well as feature extractors. The implementation results demonstrated that our proposed technique has yielded remarkable classification performance for all the concerned problems and outperformed the reported methods in terms of the universality.

The minuscule changes reflected in EEG signals among different seizure types make such tasks more challenging. Therefore, in this work, underlying features in EEG have been explored by decomposing signals into multiple subcomponents which have been further used to generate 2D input images for deep learning (DL) pipeline. The Hilbert vibration decomposition (HVD) has been employed for decomposing the EEG signals by preserving phase information. Next, 2D images have been generated considering the first three subcomponents having high energy by involving continuous wavelet transform and converting them into 2D images for DL inputs. For classification, a hybrid DL pipeline has been constructed by combining the convolution neural network (CNN) followed by long short-term memory (LSTM) for efficient extraction of spatial and time sequence information. Experimental validation has been conducted by classifying five types of seizures and seizure-free, collected from the Temple University EEG dataset (TUH v1.5.2). The proposed method has achieved the highest classification accuracy up to 99% along with an F1-score of 99%. Further analysis shows that the HVD-based decomposition and hybrid DL model can efficiently extract in-depth features while classifying different types of seizures.

In cognitive neuroscience domain, EEG-based assessment method is found to be superior due to its non-invasive ability to detect deep brain structure while exhibiting superior spatial resolutions. Especially for studying the neurodynamic behavior of epileptic seizures, EEG recordings reflect the neuronal activity of the brain and thus provide required clinical diagnostic information for the neurologist. This specific proposed study makes use of wavelet packet based log and norm entropies with a recurrent Elman neural network (REN) for the automated detection of epileptic seizures. Three conditions, normal, pre-ictal and epileptic EEG recordings were considered for the proposed study. An adaptive Weiner filter was initially applied to remove the power line noise of 50 Hz from raw EEG recordings. Raw EEGs were segmented into 1 s patterns to ensure stationarity of the signal. Then wavelet packet using Haar wavelet with a five level decomposition was introduced and two entropies, log and norm were estimated and were applied to REN classifier to perform binary classification. The non-linear Wilcoxon statistical test was applied to observe the variation in the features under these conditions. The effect of log energy entropy (without wavelets) was also studied. It was found from the simulation results that the wavelet packet log entropy with REN classifier yielded a classification accuracy of 99.70 % for normal-pre-ictal, 99.70 % for normal-epileptic and 99.85 % for pre-ictal-epileptic. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s11571-016-9408-y,10.1007/s11571-016-9408-y,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84987657596&doi=10.1007%2fs11571-016-9408-y&partnerID=40&md5=365282d410d68653faa8d75a47eca1a5,2017,28/03/2024 1:15,28/03/2024 1:15,,51-66,,1,11,,Cogn.

In this paper, we propose a promising epilepsy detection model based on convolutional transformer networks. We demonstrate that integrating convolution and transformer modules can achieve higher detection performance.

Experiments on two EEG datasets show that our model offers state-of-the-art performance.

Therefore, it is necessary to develop automated seizure detection technologies. In this paper, a new entropy named fuzzy distribution entropy (fDistEn) was first put forward and then a seizure detection scheme combining wavelet packet decomposition (WPD), fDistEn, Kruskal-Wallis nonparametric one-way analysis of variance and k-nearest neighbor (k-NN) classifier was proposed. In the proposed scheme, WPD was firstly implemented to decompose the filtered EEG into several wavelet sub-bands. Subsequently, fDistEn values of all nodes in every level were calculated and followed by selecting significant features using Kruskal-Wallis test. Finally, k-NN was employed to classify ten kinds of EEG combinations. Experimental results show fDistEn can measure the complexity of signals and our proposed scheme is qualified to detect seizure automatically with not less than 98.338% accuracy in all cases.

Patient's electroencephalography (EEG) signals are frequently used for the detection of epileptic seizure segments. In this paper, a high-resolution time-frequency (TF) representation called Synchrosqueezing Transform (SST) is used to detect epileptic seizures. Two different EEG data sets, the IKCU data set we collected, and the publicly available CHB-MIT data set are analyzed to test the performance of the proposed model in seizure detection. The SST representations of seizure and nonseizure (pre-seizure or inter-seizure) EEG segments of epilepsy patients are calculated. Various features like higher-order joint TF (HOJ-TF) moments and gray-level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM)-based features are calculated using the SST representation. By using single and ensemble machine learning methods such as k-Nearest Neighbor (kNN), Logistic Regression (LR), Naive Bayes (NB), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Boosted Trees (BT), and Subspace kNN (S-kNN), EEG features are classified. The proposed SST-based approach achieved 95.1% ACC, 96.87% PRE, 95.54% REC values for the IKCU data set, and 95.13% ACC, 93.37% PRE, 90.30% REC values for the CHB-MIT data set in seizure detection.

This paper presents a novel method for seizure detection using the Stein kernel-based sparse representation (SR) for EEG recordings. Different from the traditional SR scheme that works with vector data in Euclidean space, the Stein kernel-based SR framework is constructed for seizure detection in the space of the symmetric positive definite (SPD) matrices, which form a Riemannian manifold. Due to the non-Euclidean geometry of the Riemannian manifold, the Stein kernel on the manifold permits the embedding of the manifold in a high-dimensional reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) to perform SR. In the Stein kernel-based SR framework, EEG samples are described by SPD matrices in the form of covariance descriptors (CovDs). Then, a test EEG sample is sparsely represented on the training set, and the test sample is classified as a member of the class, which leads to the minimum reconstructed residual. Finally, by using three widely used EEG datasets to evaluate the detection performance of the proposed method, the experimental results demonstrate that it achieves good classification accuracy on each dataset. Furthermore, the fast computational speed of the Stein kernel-based SR also meets the basic requirements for real-time seizure detection. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.compbiomed.2021.104338,10.1016/j.compbiomed.2021.104338,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85106539034&doi=10.1016%2fj.compbiomed.2021.104338&partnerID=40&md5=889dfc2549b1bb541186d98aebd56e59,2021,28/03/2024 1:15,28/03/2024 1:15,,,,,132,,Comput.

Electroencephalography (EEG) is required for their detection and treatment initially. Studies show that if seizures are detected at their early stage, instant and effective treatment can be given to the patients. In this paper, an automated system for seizure onset detection is proposed. As the power spectrum of normal person's EEG and EEG of someone with epilepsy is plotted, powers present at different frequencies are found to be different for both. The proposed algorithm utilizes this frequency discrimination property of EEG with some statistical features to detect the seizure onset using simple linear classifier. The tests conducted on EEG data of 30 patients, obtained from the two different datasets, show the presence of all 183 seizures with mean latency of 0.9 s and 1.02 false detections per hour. The main contribution of this study is the use of simple features and classifier in the field of seizures onset detection that reduces the computational complexity of the algorithm. Also, the classifier used is patient independent. This patient independency in the classification system would be helpful in the implementation of the proposed algorithm to develop an online detection system.  © 2021 Walter de Gruyter GmbH, Berlin/Boston.",https://doi.org/10.1515/bmt-2020-0250,10.1515/bmt-2020-0250,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85100578846&doi=10.1515%2fbmt-2020-0250&partnerID=40&md5=f8ba2e345ae3d728d9e8893977df2f45,2021,28/03/2024 1:15,28/03/2024 1:15,,267-274,,3,66,,Biomed.

We first extract the frequency domain features from the full-channel EEG signals. Then, we use a random forest algorithm to determine which channels contribute the most in discriminating seizure from non-seizure events. Next, we apply a non-linear dimension reduction technique to capture the relationship among data elements and map them in low dimension.

During a seizure event, there are bursts of electrical activity in the cerebral cortex of brain that disturbs the normal activity of patients. This abnormal electrical activity of the brain can be assessed by electroencephalogram (EEG) signals. In this work, the wavelet transform is used to detect epileptic seizures on EEG signals and classified with machine learning methods for seizure and non-seizure events. The recorded EEG signals were collected from the CHB-MIT scalp EEG dataset and total 48 events were considered for analysis. The EEG signal is decomposed into different sub-bands using the tuneable Q-wavelet transform (TQWT) and time–frequency based feature like entropy, temporal measures were extracted to make a large data set in order to detect the epilepsy events accurately. The data set is processed further for classification of epilepsy using support vector machine (SVM) classifier and random forest (RF) classifier. It was observed that the RF classifier achieved better classification performance in terms of sensitivity of 91.5% and accuracy of 93% than the SVM classifier which were 89.2 and 90.4% only.

However, the performance of the methods on different patients varies a lot. In order to deal with this problem, we propose an automatic seizure identification method based on brain connectivity learning. The connectivity of different brain regions is modeled by a graph. Different from the manually defined graph structure, our method can extract the optimal graph structure and EEG features in an end-to-end manner. Combined with the popular graph attention neural network (GAT), this method achieves high performance and stability on different patients from the CHB-MIT dataset. The average values of accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, F1-score and AUC of the proposed model are 98.90%, 98.33%, 98.48%, 97.72% and 98.54%, respectively. The standard deviations of the above five indicators are 0.0049, 0.0125, 0.0116 and 0.0094, respectively.

An automatic epileptic seizure detection method with graph-regularized non-negative matrix factorization (GNMF) and Bayesian linear discriminate analysis (BLDA) is presented in this paper. First, discrete wavelet decomposition is applied to analyze raw electroencephalogram (EEG) signals, and the normalization based on differential operator is used to guarantee the nonnegative constraint and reinforce the distinction between seizure and non-seizure signals. Then, GNMF is employed to dimensionality reduction and feature extraction for EEG data, which could capture a parts-based representation of samples and obtain more discriminative features. The EEG features are calculated and entered into the BLDA classifier for categorized results. The public Freiburg EEG database is used to evaluate the performance of the proposed seizure detection method.

Due to the sudden and unexpected electrical discharges occurring in the brain, epilepsy occurs and is a most commonly occurring neurological disorder next to stroke. For the easy monitoring of the activities of the brain, Electroencephalography (EEG) is widely used. For the primary purpose of assessment of brain activities, EEG serves as a valuable treasure and an indispensable tool. The various information related to the physiological state of the brain can be bought out by EEG. For the analysis of the EEG records in a visual manner, expert neurologists consume more time and to detect the epileptic seizures, only EEG signals are used widely as it contains vital information. The EEG recording contains a lot of noise and so it is difficult to isolate the seizures from other artifacts with resembles more or less similar time-frequency patterns. Various automatic detection and machine learning algorithms have been used to predict the risk of epileptic seizures in raw EEG signals. In this study, the dimensions of the EEG signals are reduced initially with the help of two approaches, namely, Expectation Maximization Based Principal Component Analysis (EM-PCA) approach and Hessian Local Linear Embedding (HLLE) approach. The dimensionally reduced values are then classified to predict the risk of epilepsy from EEG signals with the help of two post classifiers namely Weighted K Nearest Neighbour (WKNN) and Linear Support Vector Machine (L-SVM). The performance metrics are analyzed in terms of various measures like Performance Index, Accuracy, Time Delay, Specificity and Sensitivity.

The visual diagnosis of epilepsy using electroencephalogram (EEG) signals is challenging, which led to the development of machine learning methods to automate this task. With the help of machine learning techniques optimized for epilepsy, this study aims to diagnose epilepsy disorders and related seizures with high accuracy. In the first step, the proposed multilevel method applies Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) to decompose the EEG signal into sub-band frequency levels. Next, the algorithm uses the Modified Binary Salp Swarm Algorithm (MBSSA), a population-based strategy, to extract time-domain features. The proposed method uses the Levenberg-Marquardt (LM) backpropagation classification model as a Feed-Forward Neural Network (FFNN). The MBSSA also optimally determine the type of WT (DWT or Double Density DWT (DDT)), the number of decomposed levels in WT, the best-fitted mother wavelet and the number of neurons in the hidden layer of FFNN, preventing manual and time-consuming calculation.

Two noise-robustness graph features based on the FWHVA, mean degree and mean strength, are investigated using two chaos signals and five groups of EEG signals. Experimental results show that feature extraction using the FWHVA is faster than that of SampEn and FFT. And mean strength feature associated with ictal EEG is significant higher than that of healthy and inter-ictal EEGs.

It is condemnatory to ascertain if the state of an epilepsy patient’s brain is symptomatic of a plausible seizure beginning; hence, EEG signals aid with the provision of significant information regarding the epileptogenic networks which is meant to be scrutinized and comprehended prior the commencement of therapeutic proceedings.

Desirable seizure prognosis depends on the ability to appropriately distinguish the preictal phase from the interictal phase of ictal in EEG. The pre-programmed seizure indication system can efficiently aid physicians to diagnose and proctor epilepsy which also decreases their amount of work.

Given that visual inspection of EEG signals is time-consuming, and that mutant signals dramatically increase the workload of neurologists, automatic epilepsy diagnosis systems are extremely helpful. However, the existing epilepsy diagnosis methods suffer from some shortcomings. For example, they tend to fall into local optima quickly because of their failure to fully consider the discriminative features of EEG signals. To tackle this problem, in this article, an enhanced automatic epilepsy diagnosis method is proposed using time-frequency analysis and improved Harris hawks optimization (IHHO) with a hierarchical mechanism. Specifically, the signal is decomposed into five rhythms using continuous wavelet transform, with the local and global features extracted using the local binary pattern and the gray level co-occurrence matrix. Discriminative features are then selected and further mapped to the final recognition results using both IHHO and the k-nearest neighbor classifier. To evaluate its performance, the proposed method was compared with a variety of classical meta-heuristic algorithms on 23 benchmark functions. Moreover, the proposed approach achieved more than 99.67% accuracy on the Bonn dataset and 99.06% accuracy on the CHB-MIT dataset, out-performing a multitude of state-of-the-art methods.

Electroencephalogram (EEG) is prevalently employed for seizure identification due to its routine and low expense collection. The stochastic nature of EEG makes manual seizure inspections laborsome, motivating automated seizure identification. The relevant literature focuses mostly on supervised machine learning. Despite their success, supervised methods require expert labels indicating seizure segments, which are difficult to obtain on clinically-acquired EEG. Thus, we aim to devise an unsupervised method for seizure identification on EEG. Methods: We propose the first fully-unsupervised deep learning method for seizure identification on raw EEG, using a variational autoencoder (VAE). In doing so, we train the VAE on recordings without seizures. As training captures non-seizure activity, we identify seizures with respect to the reconstruction errors at inference time. Moreover, we extend the traditional VAE training loss to suppress EEG artifacts. Our method does not require ground-truth expert labels indicating seizure segments or manual feature extraction. Results: We implement our method using the PyTorch library and execute experiments on an NVIDIA V100 GPU. We evaluate our method on three benchmark EEG datasets: (i) intracranial recordings from the University of Pennsylvania and the Mayo Clinic, (ii) scalp recordings from the Temple University Hospital of Philadelphia, and (iii) scalp recordings from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and the Boston Children's Hospital. To assess performance, we report accuracy, precision, recall, Area under the Receiver Operating Characteristics Curve (AUC), and p-value under the Welch t-test for distinguishing seizure vs. non-seizure EEG windows. Our approach can successfully distinguish seizures from non-seizure activity, with up to 0.83 AUC on intracranial recordings. Moreover, our algorithm has the potential for real-time inference, by processing at least 10 s of EEG in a second. Conclusion: We take the first successful steps in deep learning-based unsupervised seizure identification on raw EEG. Our approach has the potential of alleviating the burden on clinical experts regarding laborsome EEG inspections for seizures. Furthermore, aiding the identification of early seizures via our method could facilitate successful detection of epilepsy development and initiate antiepileptogenic therapies. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cmpb.2021.106604,10.1016/j.cmpb.2021.106604,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85122243973&doi=10.1016%2fj.cmpb.2021.106604&partnerID=40&md5=da3a0c6bbea1b662d3e73ae49edefcb0,2022,28/03/2024 1:15,28/03/2024 1:15,,,,,215,,Comput.

To alleviate such problem, a domain adaptation model is proposed in this paper.

By performing an adversarial training procedure, the aggregated posterior of the embedding space is matched with a Riemannian manifold-based prior that contains cross-domain information. This variational inference process can increase the generalization ability while circumventing the overfitting to source domains. Moreover, a distance measure is developed to align the distributions among various domains using the Riemannian mean. It can make the extracted features present higher domain adaptability by minimizing domain gaps in hidden space. Two common classification tasks, seizure prediction and seizure detection, are utilized for model evaluation. In the tests performed on the CHB-MIT scalp EEG dataset, the proposed model achieves a sensitivity of 82.2%, a false alarm rate (FPR) of 0.13 h−1 for seizure prediction and a sensitivity of 86.4%, an FPR of 0.08 h−1 for seizure detection. Experimental results indicate that this method can effectively reduce the domain disparity compared with state-of-the-art baselines. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bspc.2022.103555,10.1016/j.bspc.2022.103555,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85124625028&doi=10.1016%2fj.bspc.2022.103555&partnerID=40&md5=38735736514fa1e716942bd4acc83717,2022,28/03/2024 1:15,28/03/2024 1:15,,,,,75,,Biomed.

Neurologists can diagnose the seizure using several methods such as neurological examination, blood tests, computerized tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and electroencephalogram (EEG). Medical data, such as the EEG signal, usually includes a number of features and attributes that do not contains important information. This paper proposes an automatic seizure classification system based on extracting the most significant EEG features for seizure diagnosis. The proposed algorithm consists of five steps. The first step is the channel selection to minimize dimensionality by selecting the most affected channels using the variance parameter. The second step is the feature extraction to extract the most relevant features, 11 features, from the selected channels. The third step is to average the 11 features extracted from each channel. Next, the fourth step is the classification of the average features using the classification step. Finally, cross-validation and testing the proposed algorithm by dividing the dataset into training and testing sets. This paper presents a comparative study of seven classifiers. These classifiers were tested using two different methods: random case testing and continuous case testing. In the random case process, the KNN classifier had greater precision, specificity, positive predictability than the other classifiers. Still, the ensemble classifier had a higher sensitivity and a lower miss-rate (2.3%) than the other classifiers. For the continuous case test method, the ensemble classifier had higher metric parameters than the other classifiers. In addition, the ensemble classifier was able to detect all seizure cases without any mistake. © 2021, The Author(s).",https://doi.org/10.1186/s40708-021-00123-7,10.1186/s40708-021-00123-7,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85101452232&doi=10.1186%2fs40708-021-00123-7&partnerID=40&md5=7cd7db920c68df52279a435904f7d348,2021,28/03/2024 1:15,28/03/2024 1:15,,,,1,8,,Brain Informatics,,,,,,,,English,,,Scopus,,,,,"<p>ASReview_relevant</p>; <p>Export Date: 13 February 2024; Cited By: 31; Correspondence Address: M.M.

However, how far AI must have gone, it works in healthcare remains a big challenge for great minds across the globe. Epilepsy is a neurological disorder that occurs in a human being at any stage in life. Thus, frequent to rare seizures are faced by an individual having epilepsy and sometimes lead to death. The electroencephalogram (EEG) signals help diagnose this ailment. However, often long EEG signal takes a day or more even for trained neurologists to detect this disorder and may even lead to human errors. Thus, it becomes imperative to develop a robust and computationally efficient system that can help detect this ailment without causing delays and human error. This paper aims to extract the time-frequency plane from time domain signals using Short-time Fourier transform (STFT) and develop a neural network model using CNN to classify seizures.

The main aim of the paper is to reduce the dimensions of the EEG signals as the recordings of the EEG are too long to process and then classified with various post classifiers and to provide a performance comparison is provided. The dimensions of EEG signal are reduced with five different techniques like Fuzzy Mutual Information (FMI), Independent Component Analysis (ICA), Linear Graph Embedding (LGE), Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) and Variational Bayesian Matrix Factorization (VBMF). The dimensionally reduced values are then fed inside the Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) and Support Vector Machines with various Kernels like Linear Kernel, Gaussian Kernel and Polynomial Kernel to classify the epilepsy from EEG signals. An exhaustive analysis is done and the results are presented with performance metrics like performance index, sensitivity, specificity, time delay, quality values and accuracy.

Epileptic EEG signals are recorded as multichannel signals. A reliable technique for analysing multi-channel EEG signals is in urgent demand for the treatment and diagnosis of patients who have epilepsy and other brain disorders. Method: In this paper, each single EEG channel is partitioned into four segments, with each segment is further divided into small clusters. A set of statistical features are extracted from each cluster. As a result, a vector of all the features from each EEG single channel is obtained. The resulting features vector is then mapped into an undirected weighted network. The modularity of the networks is found to be the best to detect epileptic seizures in EEG signals. Other local and global network features, including clustering coefficients, average degree and closeness centrality, are also extracted and studied. All the network attributes are ranked based on their potential to detect abnormalities in EEG signals. Results: Eight pairs of combinations of EEG signals are classified by the proposed method using four well known classifiers: a least support vector machine, k-means, Naive Bayes, and K-nearest. The proposed method achieved an average of 98%, 96.5%, 99%, rand 0.012, respectively, for its accuracy, sensitivity, specificity and the false positive rate.

Electroencephalogram (EEG) is a test that measures and records the electrical activity of the brain, and is widely used in the detection and analysis of epileptic seizures. However, it is often difficult to identify critical changes in the EEG waveform by visual inspection, thus opening up a vast research challenges for developing automated methods for quantifying such subtle changes. Moreover, manual interpretation becomes complex due to nonlinear and non-stationary nature of the EEG signals. Hence, it is necessary to develop a quantitative method to automatically identify the normal and epileptic brain activities.

Moreover, the implementation of an epilepsy monitoring device that has low power and is portable requires a reliable and successful seizure detection scheme. In this work, the problem of automated epilepsy seizure detection using singe-channel EEG signals has been addressed. Methods At first, segments of EEG signals are decomposed using a newly proposed signal processing scheme, namely complete ensemble empirical mode decomposition with adaptive noise (CEEMDAN). Six spectral moments are extracted from the CEEMDAN mode functions and train and test matrices are formed afterward. These matrices are fed into the classifier to identify epileptic seizures from EEG signal segments. In this work, we implement an ensemble learning based machine learning algorithm, namely linear programming boosting (LPBoost) to perform classification. Results The efficacy of spectral features in the CEEMDAN domain is validated by graphical and statistical analyses. The performance of CEEMDAN is compared to those of its predecessors to further inspect its suitability. The effectiveness and the appropriateness of LPBoost are demonstrated as opposed to the commonly used classification models. Resubstitution and 10 fold cross-validation error analyses confirm the superior algorithm performance of the proposed scheme. The algorithmic performance of our epilepsy seizure identification scheme is also evaluated against state-of-the-art works in the literature. Experimental outcomes manifest that the proposed seizure detection scheme performs better than the existing works in terms of accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and Cohen's Kappa coefficient.

In addition, the seizure origin and spreading pattern is valuable for therapeutic planning but cannot always be manually disambiguated. Prior work in automated seizure detection has focused on engineering new features that better capture the seizure activity. However, these methods ignore crucial information in the data and are not sensitive enough to track the seizure propagation. In this work we introduce a hybrid Probabilistic Graphical Model-Convolutional Neural Network (PGM-CNN) for seizure tracking in multichannel EEG. Our model leverages the power of deep learning for data driven analysis of the raw EEG time series while retaining clinically relevant information through the latent PGM prior. We validate our hybrid model on clinical EEG data from two hospitals with distinct patient populations. Our system achieves better detection performance than baseline methods, which exclusively use PGMs or neural networks. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-20351-1_22,10.1007/978-3-030-20351-1_22,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85066139842&doi=10.1007%2f978-3-030-20351-1_22&partnerID=40&md5=87bbbc7a2a632dabd7a2a5c270fe6ecc,2019,28/03/2024 1:15,28/03/2024 1:15,,291-303,,,11492 LNCS,,,,,,,,Springer Verlag,,English,,,Scopus,,,,,"<p>ASReview_relevant</p>; <p>Export Date: 13 February 2024; Cited By: 15; Correspondence Address: J.

Clifford,A Deep Learning-Based Method for Automatic Detection of Epileptic Seizure in a Dataset With Both Generalized and Focal Seizure Types,2020 IEEE Signal Processing in Medicine and Biology Symposium (SPMB),2473-716X,,"Epilepsy is the second most popular neurological disorder affecting 65 million people around the world. Seizures are classified into two kinds; focal and generalized ictal activities, reflecting the spread of seizure activity on the brain. Focal seizures start and affect specific regions of the brain, whereas the generalized propagates throughout the brain. Current approaches to developing an automatic seizure detection algorithm do not consider the types of seizures. However, to detect the focal seizures, the locations of onset of seizure must be identified by an expert through inspection of the electroencephalogram (EEG), which is an expensive and time-consuming procedure. Moreover, most proposed methods are patient-specific and cannot be generalized on an unseen patient, limiting the clinical usage of previous studies. This work presents a generalizable seizure detection algorithm by considering different seizure types. After pre-processing data and rejecting artifacts, a deep neural network is used to extract robust representations across seizures and a population. The proposed method includes deep recurrent and convolutional neural networks to capture spatial and temporal information simultaneously. Experiments on the TUH EEG seizure dataset, which contains both generalized and focal seizures, show that the proposed method increases the accuracy over state-of-the-art from 80.72% to 82%, precision from 67.55% to 71.69%, and sensitivity from 80% to 85%.",https://doi.org/10.1109/SPMB50085.2020.9353629,10.1109/SPMB50085.2020.9353629,,5/12/2020,28/03/2024 1:15,28/03/2024 1:15,,1-Jun,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,<p>ASReview_relevant</p>,,,Electroencephalography; Sensitivity; Detection algorithms; Sociology; Statistics; Neurological diseases; Noise measurement,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2020 IEEE Signal Processing in Medicine and Biology Symposium (SPMB),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Yes,,,,Include,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the past decades, the automatic detection system of epilepsy has emerged and performed well. In this paper, a novel sparse representation-based epileptic seizure classification based on the dictionary learning with homotopy (DLWH) algorithm is proposed. The performance of the proposed method evaluates on two public EEG databases provided by the Bonn University and Childrens Hospital Boston-Massachusetts Institute of Technology (CHB-MIT), various classification cases that include health and seizure; non-seizure and seizure; inter ictal (seizure-free interval) and ictal (seizure). The results show that the DLWH only completes the test with 19.671 s compared with the traditional sparse representation methods with high degree of automation, which are better than those obtained using the well-known dictionary learning method. Besides, two publicly available benchmark databases recognition rates are as high as 100%, 99.5%, with average of 99.5% and 95.06%,% respectively, and the results show that the epileptic detection system based on the dictionary learning has a high application value. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neucom.2019.12.010,10.1016/j.neucom.2019.12.010,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85076824507&doi=10.1016%2fj.neucom.2019.12.010&partnerID=40&md5=f93b504abf74836df56b1805307acde7,2021,28/03/2024 1:15,28/03/2024 1:15,,179-192,,,424,,Neurocomputing,,,,,,,,English,,,Scopus,,,,,"<p>ASReview_relevant</p>; <p>Export Date: 13 February 2024; Cited By: 33; Correspondence Address: B.

137,2J27QBTR,journalArticle,2018,"Göksu, H.",EEG based epileptiform pattern recognition inside and outside the seizure states,Biomedical Signal Processing and Control,,17468094 (ISSN),"Automatic diagnosis of epilepsy by computers based on Electroencephalography (EEG) analysis is a beneficial practice which increases recognition rate, speeds up diagnosis and saves physicians from long hours of EEG inspection. Most studies on this subject report results on detecting seizures; but seizures, which appear during the ictal states are very rare to catch. Therefore, an efficient algorithm must be able to detect epilepsy during nonseizure periods, or in other words interictal states as well. We present a novel algorithm to detect epileptiform patterns during both states: ictal and interictal. For this purpose, we use wavelet packet analysis (WPA) rather than traditional time and frequency domain methods. WPA, by providing arbitrary time-frequency resolution, enables analyzing signals of stationary and non-stationary nature. It has better time representation than Fourier analysis and better high frequency resolution than Wavelet analysis. WPA subimages are analyzed further to obtain feature vectors of Log Energy Entropy, Norm Entropy and Energy. These features are fed into a classifier, multilayer perceptron (MLP). We test our method on a well-known and widely studied database which includes healthy, ictal and interictal EEG recordings. Normal vs. Ictal and Interictal vs. Ictal zone classifications are realized at 100% accuracy by using any of the three features. Nonseizure vs. Seizure state classification is realized with 100% accuracy using Norm entropy. Normal vs. Interictal zone classification is achieved with 100% accuracy using Log Energy Entropy. Normal vs. Interictal vs. Ictal Zone classifications are considered as two-step binary classifications of Nonseizure vs. Seizure state followed by Normal vs. Interictal zone both of which are realized at 100% accuracy. Therefore, jointly use of Log Energy Entropy and Norm entropy is able to realize all possible classifications with 100% accuracy. We make the most comprehensive comparison of results belonging to all possible classification categories reported on the same datasets. The proposed method outperforms all the other results in all possible classifications by achieving 100% accuracy in all possible classifications. The method presented is the only single method that achieves this. Overall, the method provides us with a promising tool for the detection of epileptiform patterns during and outside the seizure states. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bspc.2018.03.004,10.1016/j.bspc.2018.03.004,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85044471860&doi=10.1016%2fj.bspc.2018.03.004&partnerID=40&md5=77d82825c8d0b1272217fd6450c2711a,2018,28/03/2024 1:15,28/03/2024 1:15,,204-215,,,43,,Biomed.

Tensor-based approaches are utilized to fit the components into multi-dimensional arrays in recent works. We initially decompose EEG signals into Beta band using discrete wavelet transform (DWT). We compare patient templates with normal template for cross-wavelet analysis to obtain Wavelet cross spectrum (WCS) and Wavelet cross coherence coefficients. Next we apply parallel factorization (PARAFAC) modeling, a three-way tensor-based representation in channel, frequency and time-points dimensions on features. Finally, we utilize the ensemble classifier for detecting seizure-free, onset and seizure classes. The clinical dataset for this work comprises of 5 normal subjects and 6 epileptiform patients. The classification performances of WCS features on PARAFAC model for Seizure detection using Ensemble Bagged-Trees classifier obtains 82.21% accuracy, while for Wavelet Coherence features, it provides higher 84.76% accuracy. The results have been compared with well-known Fine Gaussian SVM, Weighted KNN and Ensemble Subspace KNN classifiers.

Electroencephalograms (EEG) help in capturing brain's electrical activity and provide aid to the clinicians for detecting and predicting seizures. EEG is quite complex and predicting seizures by visual inspection is quite challenging, time consuming and sometimes much expensive as every time a trained specialists is required for inspection. Due to these issues various expert and automated seizure detection systems have been developed for accurate and fast detection of seizures. Preliminary seizure detection and prediction algorithms were patient-specific, where the classifier's training and testing were done on the same person. The current work provides a study of generalized automated seizure detection system which can classify seizures and non-seizures signals. EEG data from CHB-MIT database is considered for analyzing and validating the proposed detection system. The signals are decomposed using wavelet decomposition tree and wavelet-coefficients are used to calculate different non-linear features viz. approximate and sample entropy, energy, standard deviation. These features are classified by different supervised machine learning classifiers such as Support Vector Machine (SVM), Probabilistic Neural Network (PNN), K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) and Linear Discriminant Classifier (LDC). The classifiers performance is compared using sensitivity, specificity, accuracy. The PNN classifier provided reasonably good results as compared to the other classifiers.

There is no effective strategy for selecting the number of channels and spatial filters in feature extraction of multichannel EEG data. Therefore, this paper combined sparse idea and greedy search algorithm to improve the feature extraction of common space pattern. The feature extraction can effectively overcome the repeating selection problem of feature pattern in the eigenvector space by the traditional method. Then we used the Fisher linear discriminant analysis to realize the classification. The results show that the proposed method can get high classification accuracy using fewer data. For 10 subjects, the averaged accuracy of epilepsy detection is more than 99%.

However, the conventional method of manually analysing the EEG signals, for seizure diagnosis and its types identification is onerous and it is error-prone. Hence, a novel relaxed local neighbour difference pattern (RLNDiP) technique integrated with artificial neural network is introduced in this article for robust and accurate automatic classification of normal(N), generalized(G), and focal(F) EEG signals. The proposed unified framework consists of two phases. Firstly, the EEG signals are pre-processed and transformed into RLNDiP domain, using the proposed method. The histogram features are computed to perform the classification task. Secondly, the most prominent features are selected using the Kruskal–Wallis test and given into ANN network for discrimination. To find out the best number of hidden layers and hidden neurons of ANN, the experiments with 5-fold cross validation technique is conducted with the train set. Finally, with the best values ANN network is trained employing the entire train set and evaluated on test set. Proposed methodology is validated using the Karunya Institute of Technology and Sciences (KITS) database consisting of 86 EEG signals in each group. The proposed method attained an overall classification accuracy of 100% with train set, and 95.83% with test set.

Most previous methods were based only on signal features derived from the instantaneous frequency and energies of EEG signals in different spectral sub-bands. The proposed features based on image descriptors are extracted from the T-F representation of EEG signals and are considered and processed as an image using T-F image processing techniques. The proposed features include shape and texture-based descriptors and are able to describe visually the normal and seizure activity patterns observed in T-F images. The results obtained on real EEG data show that T-F image descriptor-based features achieve an overall classification accuracy of up to 98% for 100 EEG segments using one-against-one SVM classifier.

The primary goal of this research article is to propose a novel human-centered cognitive computing (HCCC) method for segment-wise seizure classification by employing multiresolution extracted data with directed transfer function (DTF) features, termed as the multiresolution directed transfer function (MDTF) approach. Initially, the multiresolution information of the epileptic seizure signal is extracted using a multiresolution adaptive filtering (MRAF) method. These seizure details are passed to the DTF where the information flow of high frequency bands is computed. Thereafter, different measures of complexity such as approximate entropy (AEN) and sample entropy (SAEN) are computed from the extracted high frequency bands. Lastly, a k-nearest neighbor (k-NN) and support vector machine (SVM) are used for classifying the EEG signal into non-seizure and seizure data depending on the multiresolution based information flow characteristics. The MDTF approach is tested on a standard dataset and validated using a dataset from a local hospital. The proposed technique has obtained an average sensitivity of 98.31%, specificity of 96.13% and accuracy of 98.89% using SVM classifier. The average detection rate of the MDTF approach is 97.72% which is greater than the existing approaches. The proposed MDTF method will help neuro-specialists to locate seizure information drift which occurs within the consecutive segments and between two channels. The main advantage of the MDTF approach is its capability to locate the seizure activity contained by the EEG signal with accuracy. This will assist the neurologists with the precise localization of the epileptic seizure automatically and hence will reduce the burden of time-consuming epileptic seizure analysis. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s11571-021-09773-z,10.1007/s11571-021-09773-z,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85122331669&doi=10.1007%2fs11571-021-09773-z&partnerID=40&md5=2b97c7275816c85d7ceb414945a70617,2022,28/03/2024 1:15,28/03/2024 1:15,,,,,,,Cogn.

To the best of the author's knowledge, existing studies have validated their algorithms using cross-validation on the same database and less number of attempts have been made to extend their work on other databases to test the generalization capability of the developed algorithms. In this study, we present the algorithm for cross-database evaluation for classification of epileptic seizures using five EEG databases collected from different centers. The cross-database framework helps when sufficient epileptic seizures EEG data are not available to build automated seizure detection model. Methods: Two features, namely successive decomposition index and matrix determinant were extracted at a segmentation length of 4 s (50% overlap). Then, adaptive median feature baseline correction (AM-FBC) was applied to overcome the inter-patient and inter-database variation in the feature distribution. The classification was performed using a support vector machine classifier with leave-one-database-out cross-validation. Different classification scenarios were considered using AM-FBC, smoothing of the train and test data, and post-processing of the classifier output. Results: Simulation results revealed the highest area under the curve-sensitivity-specificity-false detections (per hour) of 1–1–1–0.15, 0.89–0.99–0.82–2.5, 0.99–0.73–1–1, 0.95–0.97–0.85–1.7, 0.99–0.99–0.92–1.1 using the Ramaiah Medical College and Hospitals, Children's Hospital Boston-Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Temple University Hospital, Maastricht University Medical Centre, and University of Bonn databases respectively. Conclusions: We observe that the AM-FBC plays a significant role in improving seizure detection results by overcoming inter-database variation of feature distribution. Significance: To the best of the author's knowledge, this is the first study reporting on the cross-database evaluation of classification of epileptic seizures and proven to be better generalization capability when evaluated using five databases and can contribute to accurate and robust detection of epileptic seizures in real-time. © 2020 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.clinph.2020.03.033,10.1016/j.clinph.2020.03.033,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85084527370&doi=10.1016%2fj.clinph.2020.03.033&partnerID=40&md5=c46fa807b3772d801ddce441f15260a1,2020,28/03/2024 1:15,28/03/2024 1:15,,1567-1578,,7,131,,Clin.

The prediction of epileptic seizure usually requires a detailed and experienced analysis of EEG. In this paper, we have introduced a statistical analysis of EEG signal that is capable of recognizing epileptic seizure with a high degree of accuracy and helps to provide automatic detection of epileptic seizure for different ages of epilepsy. To accomplish the target research, we extract various epileptic features namely approximate entropy (ApEn), standard deviation (SD), standard error (SE), modified mean absolute value (MMAV), roll-off (R), and zero crossing (ZC) from the epileptic signal. The k-nearest neighbours (k-NN) algorithm is used for the classification of epilepsy then regression analysis is used for the prediction of the epilepsy level at different ages of the patients. Using the statistical parameters and regression analysis, a prototype mathematical model is proposed which helps to find the epileptic randomness with respect to the age of different subjects.

The main objective of this study is to achieve an accurate as well as timely classification model which would help in the detection of epileptic EEG signals. This is very important as the patient suffering from epilepsy should receive proper medical attention hours before seizures occur. Thus the importance of fast and accurate analysis of different biomedical signals is growing at an ever increasing rate. In this study we have developed a feature extractor which when integrated with a classifier based on the Learning Vector Quantization (LVQ) algorithm classifies EEG signals into two categories viz. healthy and epileptic. The feature extractor uses the Hilbert Transform to convert real-time series EEG signals into an analytic signal which makes it easier to perform the requisite analysis. 5 sets of EEG signals from a publicly available EEG time series database were used to develop the proposed model on MATLAB.

To overcome such disadvantages, numerous seizure detection techniques involving signal processing and machine learning tools have been developed. However, there still remain the problems of automatic detection with high efficiency and accuracy in distinguishing normal, interictal and ictal electroencephalogram (EEG) signals. In this study we propose a novel method for automatic identification of epileptic seizures in singe-channel EEG signals based upon time-scale decomposition (ITD), discrete wavelet transform (DWT), phase space reconstruction (PSR) and neural networks. First, EEG signals are decomposed into a series of proper rotation components (PRCs) and a baseline signal by using the ITD method. The first two PRCs of the EEG signals are extracted, which contain most of the EEG signals’ energy and are considered to be the predominant PRCs. Second, four levels DWT is employed to decompose the predominant PRCs into different frequency bands, in which third-order Daubechies (db3) wavelet function is selected for analysis. Third, phase space of the PRCs is reconstructed based on db3, in which the properties associated with the nonlinear EEG system dynamics are preserved. Three-dimensional (3D) PSR together with Euclidean distance (ED) has been utilized to derive features, which demonstrate significant difference in EEG system dynamics between normal, interictal and ictal EEG signals. Fourth, neural networks are then used to model, identify and classify EEG system dynamics between normal (healthy), interictal and ictal EEG signals. Finally, experiments are carried out on the University of Bonn’s widely used and publicly available epilepsy dataset to assess the effectiveness of the proposed method. By using the 10-fold cross-validation style, the achieved average classification accuracy for eleven cases is reported to be 98.15%. Compared with many state-of-the-art methods, the results demonstrate superior performance and the proposed method can serve as a potential candidate for the automatic detection of seizure EEG signals in the clinical application. © 2019, Springer Nature B.V.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s10462-019-09755-y,10.1007/s10462-019-09755-y,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85071507871&doi=10.1007%2fs10462-019-09755-y&partnerID=40&md5=1513baa46b1a67148aa4c64b1b56cac7,2020,28/03/2024 1:15,28/03/2024 1:15,,3059-3088,,4,53,,Artif Intell Rev,,,,,,,,English,,,Scopus,,,,,"<p>ASReview_relevant</p>; <p>Export Date: 13 February 2024; Cited By: 25; Correspondence Address: W.

A novel seizure detection method based on the deep bidirectional long short-term memory (Bi-LSTM) network is proposed in this paper. To preserve the non-stationary nature of EEG signals while decreasing the computational burden, the local mean decomposition (LMD) and statistical feature extraction procedures are introduced. The deep architecture is then designed by combining two independent LSTM networks with the opposite propagation directions: one transmits information from the front to the back, and another from the back to the front. Thus the deep model can take advantage of the information both before and after the currently analyzing moment to jointly determine the output state. A mean sensitivity of 93.61% and a mean specificity of 91.85% were achieved on a long-term scalp EEG database. The comparisons with other published methods based on either traditional machine learning models or convolutional neural networks demonstrated the improved performance for seizure detection. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.compbiomed.2020.103919,10.1016/j.compbiomed.2020.103919,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85089138923&doi=10.1016%2fj.compbiomed.2020.103919&partnerID=40&md5=5297b9c3bde673ab69e64d406eb9806b,2020,28/03/2024 1:15,28/03/2024 1:15,,,,,124,,Comput.

In other forms of epilepsy, the commonly used clinical approach mainly involves manual inspection of encephalography (EEG) signals, a laborious and time-consuming process which often requires the contribution of more than one experienced neurologist. In the last decades, numerous approaches to automate this detection have been proposed and, more recently, machine learning has shown very promising performance. In this paper, an original Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture is proposed to develop patient-specific seizure detection models for three patients affected by NFLE. The performances, in terms of accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity, exceed by several percentage points those in the most recent literature. The capability of the patient-specific models has been also tested to compare the obtained seizure onset times with those provided by the neurologists, with encouraging results. Moreover, the same CNN architecture has been used to develop a cross-patient seizure detection system, resorting to the transfer-learning paradigm. Starting from a patient-specific model, few data from a new patient are enough to customize his model.

In this article, an epileptic seizure onset detection algorithm based on general tensor discriminant analysis is proposed to detect the seizure through EEG signals with smallest delay before the development of clinical symptoms. In this algorithm, seizure and nonseizure EEG signal epochs are exhibited by spectral, spatial, and temporal domains (third-order tensors) in wavelet decomposition. Then, to reduce feature space, projection matrices are extracted from tensor-represented EEG signal by general tensor discriminant analysis. In this strategy, the discriminative information in the training tensors is preserved that it is a benefit in comparison with common feature space reduction algorithms such as principal component analysis and multilinear subspace analysis. The proposed seizure onset detection algorithm is evaluated on 44 epileptic patients from 2 standard datasets and recognizes 98% of seizures with average delay of 4.5 seconds.

Visual identification of epileptic seizure in long-term EEG is cumbersome and tedious for neurologists, which might also lead to human error. Therefore, an automated tool for accurate detection of seizures in a long-term multi-channel EEG is essential for the clinical diagnosis. This study proposes an algorithm using multi-features and multilayer perceptron neural network (MLPNN) classifier. After appropriate approval from the ethical committee, recordings of EEG data were collected from the Institute of Neurosciences, Ramaiah Memorial College and Hospital, Bengaluru. Initially, preprocessing was performed to remove the power-line noise and motion artifacts. Four features, namely power spectral density (Yule–Walker), entropy (Shannon and Renyi), and Teager energy, were extracted. The Wilcoxon rank-sum test and descriptive analysis ensure the suitability of the proposed features for pattern classification. Single and multi-features were fed to the MLPNN classifier to evaluate the performance of the study. The simulation results showed sensitivity, specificity, and false detection rate of 97.1%, 97.8%, and 1 h−1, respectively, using multi-features.

An automatic detection of epileptic seizure method based on kernel-based robust probabilistic collaborative representation (ProCRC) combined with graph-regularized non-negative matrix factorization (GNMF) is proposed in this work. The raw EEG signals are pre-processed through the wavelet transform to obtain time-frequency distribution of EEG signals as preliminary feature information and GNMF is further employed for dimension reduction, retaining and enhancing the productive feature information of EEG signals. Then, the test sample is represented using robust ProCRC that can decide whether the testing sample belongs to each class (seizure or non-seizure) by jointly maximizing the likelihood. In addition, the kernel trick is applied to improve the separability of non-linear high dimensional EEG signals in robust ProCRC. Finally, post-processing techniques are introduced to generate more accurate and reliable results.

WPE is a modified statistical parameter of the permutation entropy (PE) that measures the complexity and irregularity of a time series. It incorporates both the mapped ordinal pattern of the time series and the information contained in the amplitude of its sample points.

In this paper, an EEG signal classification method based on sparse auto-encoders (SAE) and support vector machine (SVM) is proposed to greatly reduce the sample rate and enhance the efficiency of the vision detection. In practical application, sparse auto-encoder can get all the significant information at lower sample rate than sampled by Nyquist sampling principle. Due to this, it is widely used to extract higher layer features automatically. With the latter, it is used to obtain the high-dimensional pattern information of EEG signals, and map the input mode space into corresponding sparse space. This approach is precise enough to each sampling point rather than the conventional time window in the current researches and also has a better classification speed in comparison to other conventional methods. In order to ensure good classification rates (100%) for the EEG database, SVM is used to construct the generalized optimal classification hyper plane.

Accurate seizure detection in the long-term electroencephalogram (EEG) signals has gained vital importance in the diagnosis of patients with epilepsy. Visual interpretation and detection of epileptic seizures in long-term EEG is a time-consuming and burdensome task for neurologists. Therefore, in this study, we propose a computationally efficient automated seizure detection model using a novel feature called successive decomposition index (SDI). We observed that the SDI feature was significantly higher during the epileptic seizure as compared to normal EEG. The performance of the proposed method was evaluated using three databases, namely the Ramaiah Medical College and Hospital (DB1), CHB-MIT (DB2) and the Temple University Hospital (DB3) consisting of 58 h, 884 h, and 408 h of EEG, respectively. Experimental results revealed the sensitivity–false detection rate–median detection delay of 97.53%–0.4/h–1.5 s, 97.28%–0.57/h–1.7 s, and 95.80%–0.49/h–1.5 s for DB1, DB2, and DB3, respectively, using the support vector machine classifier. The proposed method significantly outperformed previously presented methods (wavelets and other feature extraction methods) while being computationally more efficient. Further, to the best of the author’s knowledge, present study is the first study that was tested on three different EEG databases and showed consistent results leading to the generalization and robustness of the algorithm. Hence, the proposed method is an efficient tool for neurologists to detect epileptic seizures in long-term EEG. © 2019, Springer-Verlag London Ltd., part of Springer Nature.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s00521-019-04389-1,10.1007/s00521-019-04389-1,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85069994060&doi=10.1007%2fs00521-019-04389-1&partnerID=40&md5=3ddf01729ef410887033f640eadc9add,2020,28/03/2024 1:15,28/03/2024 1:15,,8965-8984,,13,32,,Neural Comput.

The brain’s electrical signals can be recorded using an electroencephalogram (EEG). EEG recordings can be used to monitor complex and non-stationary signals produced by the brain for detecting epilepsy seizures. Machine learning (ML) methods have been successfully applied in different domains to accurately classify the patterns based upon dataset features. However, ML methods are unable to analyze the raw EEG signals. Appropriate features must be extracted from EEG recordings for detecting epilepsy seizures using signal processing methods. This work proposes an intelligent system by integrating variational mode decomposition (VMD) and Hilbert transform (HT) method for extracting useful features from EEG signals and stacked neural network (NN) method for detecting epilepsy seizures. VMD method decomposers EEG signals into intrinsic mode functions, followed by the HT method for extracting features from EEG signals. The stacked-NN approach is applied for detecting epilepsy seizures using extracted features. The performance of the proposed system is validated using benchmark datasets for epilepsy seizure detection provided by Bonn University and, Neurology and Sleep Centre, New Delhi (NSC-ND). The performance of the proposed system is compared with other ML methods and state of the art approaches in the field. The reported results demonstrate that the proposed system can detect up to 100% accurate epilepsy seizures using NSC-ND data set and up to 99% accurate epilepsy seizures using Bonn university dataset. The comparative results also demonstrate the better performance of the proposed system over other ML methods and existing approaches for detecting epilepsy seizures.

Automatic detection assumes a significant role in the finding of epilepsy for it can get imperceptible data of Epileptic Electroencephalogram Signals precisely and diminish the burdens of medical field. The Brain’s function is monitored by using these EEG signals electrically. The goal of this paper is to find a classification on Electroencephalogram (EEG) signals using the Bonn University datasets. In order to address this challenge, we propose a new Peak Signal Features (PSF) method which extracts high and low peak features from EEG signals. In addition, Support Vector Machine, Decision Tree and K-Nearest Neighbor are used for classification. Finally, overall accuracy and the Mean Square Error rates of the above three classification methods with proposed method are measured.

Epilepsy patients suffer from severe detrimental effects like physical injury or depression due to unpredictable seizures. However, even in hospitals due to the high rate of false positives, the seizure alert systems are of poor help for patients as tools of seizure detection are mostly trained on unrealistically clean data, containing little noise and obtained under controlled laboratory conditions, where patient groups are homogeneous, e.g. in terms of age or type of seizures. In this study authors present the approach for detection and classification of a seizure using clinical data of electroencephalograms and a convolutional neural network trained on features of brain synchronisation and power spectrum. Various deep learning methods were applied, and the network was trained on a very heterogeneous clinical electroencephalogram dataset. In total, eight different types of seizures were considered, and the patients were of various ages, health conditions and they were observed under clinical conditions. Despite this, the classifier presented in this paper achieved sensitivity and specificity equal to 0.68 and 0.67, accordingly, which is a significant improvement as compared to the known results for clinical data.

Electroencephalogram (EEG) is the most common technique used for Epilepsy diagnosis. Generally, it is done by the manual inspection of the EEG recordings of active seizure periods (ictal). Several techniques have been proposed throughout the years to automate this process. In this study, we have developed three different approaches to extract features from the filtered EEG signals. The first approach was to extract eight statistical features directly from the time-domain signal. In the second approach, we have used only the frequency domain information by applying the Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) to the EEG signals then extracting two statistical features from the lower coefficients. In the last approach, we have used a tool that combines both time and frequency domain information, which is the Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT). Six different wavelet families have been tested with their different orders resulting in 37 wavelets. The first three decomposition levels were tested with every wavelet. Instead of feeding the coefficients directly to the classifier, we summarized them in 16 statistical features. The extracted features are then fed to three different classifiers k-Nearest Neighbor (k-NN), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Artificial Neural Network (ANN) to perform two binary classification scenarios: healthy versus epileptic (mainly from interictal activity), and seizure-free versus ictal. We have used a benchmark database, the Bonn database, which consists of five different sets. In the first scenario, we have taken six different combinations of the available data. While in the second scenario, we have taken five combinations. For Epilepsy detection (healthy vs epileptic), the first approach performed badly. Using the DCT improved the results, but the best accuracies were obtained with the DWT-based approach. For seizure detection, the three methods performed quite well. However, the third method had the best performance and was better than many state-of-the-art methods in terms of accuracy. After carrying out the experiments on the whole EEG signal, we separated the five rhythms and applied the DWT on them with the Daubechies7 (db7) wavelet for feature extraction. We have observed that close accuracies to those recorded before can be achieved with only the Delta rhythm in the first scenario (Epilepsy detection) and the Beta rhythm in the second scenario (seizure detection). © 2022 Slovene Society Informatika.

Automating this process, especially seizure detection relying on scalp-based Electroencephalography (EEG) and intracranial EEG, has been the focus of research over recent decades. Nevertheless, its numerous challenges have inhibited a definitive solution. Inspired by recent advances in deep learning, here we describe a new classification approach for EEG time series based on Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) via the use of Long- Short Term Memory (LSTM) networks. The proposed deep network effectively learns and models discriminative temporal patterns from EEG sequential data. Especially, the features are automatically discovered from the raw EEG data without any pre-processing step, eliminating humans from laborious feature design task. Our light-weight system has a low computational complexity and reduced memory requirement for large training datasets.

The early diagnosis of a seizure is important in clinical therapy. An automatic epileptic seizure detection method for electroencephalogram (EEG) signals can significantly enhance the patient's life in clinical aspect. The proposed paper is principally based on a completely unique approach of epileptic seizure detection using Q-Tuned Wavelet Transform (QTWT) and Approximate entropy (ApEn). This work focuses by utilizing and testing the common sense of Extreme Learning Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System Model (EXL-ANFIS) which foresees the elements of the mind states as a trajectory that results in the seizure event. QTWT is used for decomposing EEG signals into sub-band frequency signals. Approximate entropy is carried out to those sub-band signals as a discriminatory function because of its indefinite disordered feature. The solutions obtained by directing towards EXL-ANFIS shows an incredible advancement in the perpetual performance outlay for the classification of an epileptic seizure. The proposed classification method is implemented on publicly available Bonn dataset. The outcome confirms that by combining extreme learning and ANFIS model improves the classification accuracy and decrease the feature dimension with reduced computational complexity. This method achieves 99.72% of classification accuracy over existing models. © 2020-IOS Press and the authors.

We evaluate here the power of a deep CNN to learn robust features from raw Electroencephalogram (EEG) data to detect seizures. Seizures are hard to detect, as they vary both inter- and intra-patient. In this article, we use a deep CNN model for seizure detection task on an open-access EEG epilepsy dataset collected at the Boston Children's Hospital. Our deep learning model is able to extract spectral, temporal features from EEG epilepsy data and use them to learn the general structure of a seizure that is less sensitive to variations. For cross-patient EEG data, our method produced an overall sensitivity of 90.00%, specificity of 91.65%, and overall accuracy of 98.05% for the whole dataset of 23 patients. The system can detect seizures with an accuracy of 99.46%. Thus, it can be used as an excellent cross-patient seizure classifier. The results show that our model performs better than the previous state-of-the-art models for patient-specific and cross-patient seizure detection task.

The detection of epileptic seizure by the way of visual inspection is time-consuming, so the study for automatic seizure detection methods toward long-term electroencephalogram (EEG) recording is valuable. Due to the nonstationary characteristics of EEG signal, traditional analysis methods cannot achieve epilepsy diagnosis successfully. In this paper, we presented a method, namely, the patient-specific automatic seizure detection method, to identify epilepsy in EEG signals.

However, the visual interpretation and inspection of iEEG signal is subjective variability, a time-consuming mechanism, slow and vulnerable to errors. In this research article, an automated epileptic seizure detection model is proposed to highlight the above-mentioned concerns. The proposed automated model integrates the Reconstruction Independent Component Analysis (RICA) and Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) for seizure detection. In the proposed model, RICA is utilized to extract the features from the normalized iEEG signals, and then the obtained feature vectors are fed to the LSTM network for classification, which effectively classifies inter-ictal and ictal iEEG signals. This experimental outcome showed that the proposed RICA-LSTM model achieved an accuracy of 98.92%, sensitivity of 99.01%, specificity of 98.68%, balanced accuracy of 99.24%, and f-score of 98.25% in epileptic seizure recognition on the SWEC-ETHZ iEEG database, which is better compared to the conventional machine learning classifiers. © 2021. by the authors.

The seizure detection by human inspection of EEG signals is prone to errors, inaccurate as well as time-consuming. Several attempts have been made to develop automatic systems so as to assist neurophysiologists in identifying epileptic seizures accurately. The proposed study brings forth a novel automatic approach to detect epileptic seizures using analytic time-frequency flexible wavelet transform (ATFFWT) and fractal dimension (FD). The ATFFWT has inherent attractive features such as, shift-invariance property, tunable oscillatory attribute and flexible time-frequency covering favorable for the analysis of non-stationary and transient signals. We have used ATFFWT to decompose EEG signals into the desired subbands. Following the ATFFWT decomposition, we calculate FD for each subband. Finally, FDs of all subbands have been fed to the least-squares support vector machine (LS-SVM) classifier. The 10-fold cross validation has been used to obtain stable and reliable performance and to avoid the over fitting of the model. In this study, we investigate various different classification problems (CPs) pertaining to different classes of EEG signals, including the following popular CPs: (i) ictal versus normal (ii) ictal versus inter-ictal (iii) ictal versus non-ictal. The proposed model is found to be outperforming all existing models in terms of classification sensitivity (CSE) as it achieves perfect 100% sensitivity for seven CPs investigated by us. The prominent attribute of the proposed system is that though the model employs only one set of discriminating features (FD) for all CPs, it yields promising classification accuracy. Since, the proposed model attains the perfect classification performance it appears that a system is in place to assist clinicians to diagnose seizures accurately in less time. Further, the proposed system seems useful and attractive, especially, in the rural areas of developing countries where there is a shortage of experienced clinicians and expensive machines like functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.patrec.2017.03.023,10.1016/j.patrec.2017.03.023,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85016502125&doi=10.1016%2fj.patrec.2017.03.023&partnerID=40&md5=e55086d5039b2653fd19ac1070ee312a,2017,28/03/2024 1:15,28/03/2024 1:15,,172-179,,,94,,Pattern Recogn.

Epilepsy patients suffer from recurring seizures that can be very harmful. The unpredictability of seizures is a major concern for medical practitioners because uncontrollable seizures can lead to sudden death and morbidity. A system that could warn patients and doctors alike about the impending seizure event would dramatically enhance the quality of life for patients. Methods: While most previous research works focused on using signal processing tools appropriate for stationary signals, we propose here to use time and frequency (TF) analysis to extract features capable of discriminating normal from abnormal EEG traces (both ictal and interictal). The features are extracted using Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) of the EEG signal Time Frequency matrix. The left singular vectors of the time frequency matrix are used to obtain robust feature vectors. In contrast to existing techniques, the proposed TF-based technique can be used to detect the specific moments of seizure occurrences in time so that this information is used to discriminate interictal from ictal EEG traces. Instead of extracting the features directly from the TF matrix, we transform the left eigenvectors obtained from the SVD of the TF matrix into a feature vector that behaves like to a probability density function. Results: We show that almost all classical classification techniques achieve excellent seizure detection results when used with the proposed TF features, irrespective of the classifier used. Contrary to existing works, we test our approach across several real-life scenarios covering 2, 3, and 5 possible classes of data. Our tests provided consistent results across different scenarios. The results, under different scenarios, outperformed existing ones achieving consistently more than 97.3% and up to 99.5% in terms of accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity. Conclusion: Experimental results show that the novel features have successfully represented the characteristics of the underlying disease phenomenon from EEG data. Also, we conclude that learning based classifiers are better suited for this application, compared to Bayesian classifiers that have difficulty in adapting to the varying nature of the features’ probability distribution function. © 2019 AGBM",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.irbm.2019.02.002,10.1016/j.irbm.2019.02.002,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85062057168&doi=10.1016%2fj.irbm.2019.02.002&partnerID=40&md5=09e53a8c2e048fef1a9ab3ca696de31e,2019,28/03/2024 1:15,28/03/2024 1:15,,122-132,,2,40,,IRBM,,,,,,,,English,,,Scopus,,,,,"<p>ASReview_relevant</p>; <p>Export Date: 13 February 2024; Cited By: 18; Correspondence Address: M.

In this paper, two main contributions are presented and validated: the use of non-linear classifiers through the so-called kernel trick and the proposal of a Bag-of-Words model for extracting a non-linear feature representation of the input data in an unsupervised manner. The performance of the resulting system is validated with public datasets, previously processed to remove artifacts or external disturbances, but also with private datasets recorded under realistic and non-ideal operating conditions. The use of public datasets caters for comparison purposes whereas the private one shows the performance of the system under realistic circumstances of noise, artifacts, and signals of different amplitudes. Moreover, the proposed solution has been compared to state-of-the-art works not only for pre-processed and public datasets but also with the private datasets.

This method stand out compared to other proposed methods because of its algorithmic elegance and accuracy. A wavelet is a mathematical function based on time-frequency analysis in signal processing. It is useful particularly because it allows a weak signal to be recovered from a noisy signal without much distortion. A wavelet analysis works by analysing the image and converting it to mathematical function which is decoded by the receiver. Furthermore, we have used Shannon entropy and approximate entropy (ApEn) for extracting the complexities associated with electroencephalographic (EEG) signals. The ApEn is a suitable feature to characterise the EEGs because its value drops suddenly due to excessive synchronous discharge of neurons in the brain during epileptic activity in this study. EEG signals are decomposed into six EEG sub-bands namely D1–D5 and A5 using DWT technique. Non-linear features such as ApEn and Shannon entropy are calculated from these sub-bands and support vector machine classifiers are used for classification purpose. This scheme is tested using EEG data recorded from five healthy subjects and five epileptic patients during the inter-ictal and ictal periods. The data are acquired from University of Bonn, Germany.

197,SB9SDC62,journalArticle,2022,"Palanichamy, I.; Basheer Ahamed, F.B.",Prediction of Seizure in the EEG Signal with Time Aware Recurrent Neural Network,Revue d'Intelligence Artificielle,,0992499X (ISSN),"The human brain's actions are reflected by the significant physiological data relying on the Electroencephalogram (EEG), which is utilized in the detection of epileptic seizures and the diagnosis of epilepsy. The visual inspection process of a vast quantity of EEG data by any human expert is time-consuming and the judgemental process may vary or be inconsistent among the physician. Hence, an automated process in detection and diagnosis is initiated by utilizing deep learning approaches. The Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is incorporated to correctly recognize the irregular inter-ictal discharges as non-seizures, but could not detect the ictal state and slower oscillations. To improve the performance of CNN for detecting seizures' ictal state and slower oscillations, Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) is combined with the CNN model. An RNN evokes every processed information via time and it assists in the prediction of time series data. The processed feature in RNN remembers the preceding input information which is Long Short Term Memory (LSTM). The investigational outcome of the proposed Time Aware CNN and Recurrent Neural Network (TA-CNN-RNN) attained effective classification accuracy. The experiments analysis exhibits that the TA-CNN-RNN achieves an accuracy of 89%, 88.6%, and 88.7% on CHB-MIT-EEG, Bonn-iEEG, and VIRGO-EEG databases, respectively compared to the Entropy+LSSVM, LBP+KNN and P-one-class SVM methods for epilepsy detection. © 2022 Lavoisier.

However, it also takes a lot of time for clinicians to correctly interpret the long-time recordings. Real-time computer-based EEG monitoring and classification systems have attracted recently the attention of researchers to help clinicians locate online possible epileptic-form EEG signals. In this paper, we first present an accurate and fast EEG classification algorithm that can recognize three types of EEG signals: normal, spike, and seizure. 16-channel bipolar EEG recordings of epilepsy patients are preprocessed, segmented, and ensemble empirical mode decomposed (EEMD) into intrinsic mode functions (IMFs). Features are extracted and linear discriminant analysis (LDA) is applied to train two classifiers: one is for seizure and non-seizure discrimination, and the other is for normal and spike discrimination. In order to furthermore help the clinicians, the results of LDA are visualized and sonified. The changes of the discriminant in the LDA on continuous EEG segments are backtracked to each feature, and thus to each EEG channel. Accordingly, contours of the changes in EEG channels are depicted. At the same time, sinusoidal waves in 440 or 880 Hz are played when EEG segments are classified into spike or seizure respectively. In the experiment, EEG recordings of six subjects (two normal and four seizure patients) are examined. The experiment result shows that the accuracy of the proposed epileptic EEG classification algorithm is relatively high. In addition, the visualization and sonification algorithms of epileptic-form EEG may greatly help clinicians localize the focus of seizure and nurses take care of seizure patients, immediately. © 2018, Taiwanese Society of Biomedical Engineering.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s40846-017-0358-6,10.1007/s40846-017-0358-6,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85056426112&doi=10.1007%2fs40846-017-0358-6&partnerID=40&md5=d357f9e36a8ddbcf3099b8e8849c8ef8,2018,28/03/2024 1:15,28/03/2024 1:15,,943-952,,6,38,,J.

Various research directions have focused on the detection and classification of epilepsy using machine learning methods. However, the prevailing methods have shortcomings like low classification rates and slow convergence. To address those limitations, this paper designs a fully automated system based on Hybrid Grey Wolf Optimizer-Improved Sine Cosine Algorithm (HGWOISCA) enhanced Support Vector Machine (SVM) named HGWOISCA-SVM for EEG signal classification. Primarily, unprocessed EEG signals are denoised by using an improved wavelet thresholding function to diminish noise and redundant data. Secondarily, three types of features such as wavelet domain features, time-domain features, and chaotic features are computed from the preprocessed EEG signals. In the following phase, Enhanced Grasshopper Optimization Algorithm (EGOA) is adopted to select optimal features with high discriminative power and to reduce dimensionality. Finally, the selected features are input into the HGWOISCA-SVM to differentiate healthy EEG signals from epileptic seizure signals. The effectiveness of the developed system is investigated by using Bonn university data and clinical data. Experiential results prove that the developed system yields a high classification rate of 100% for Bonn university data and 99.9% for clinical data, proving to be a powerful system for epilepsy classification. A comparison of the proposed system with the existing epileptic seizure detection methods is also done for validation. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bspc.2022.103841,10.1016/j.bspc.2022.103841,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85132237600&doi=10.1016%2fj.bspc.2022.103841&partnerID=40&md5=54dbf4eb8ce2c37efbf88c37b032eecd,2022,28/03/2024 1:15,28/03/2024 1:15,,,,,78,,Biomed.

It has various symptoms, as loss of awareness, irregular behavior, and seizure. Electroencephalogram (EEG) waveform is a prime source commonly used for the diagnosis of epilepsy. However, the EEG-based diagnosis faces many issues in real-time situations due to the coupling of various noises and the non-stationary nature of the signals which affects the accuracy of detection of an epileptic seizure. Therefore, a machine learning approach is proposed for the automatic detection of epileptic seizures by training the model to differentiate the seizure and normal person based on EEG signal artifacts. In this work, the Principal Component Analysis (PCA) has been used to reduce the dimensionality of the EEG dataset. The results on the dataset show superior performance of the proposed approach.

201,LYD9MVRT,conferencePaper,2019,"Qaisar, S.M.; Subasi, A.",Efficient Epileptic Seizure Detection Based on the Event Driven Processing,Procedia Comput. Sci.,18770509 (ISSN),,"Big number of people all over the world is affected by epilepsy. Electroencephalography (EEG) is a crucial component in the evaluation of epilepsy. Onset seizure detection is essential to prevent the seizure activity and improve patients' life quality. Presurgical treatment, precise assessment, seizure prevention, and emergency alerts all depend on the quick detection of seizure onset. Moreover, manual examination of EEG signals is boring and time-consuming task. Numerous automated epileptic seizure detection schemes have been developed to help neurologists. The aim of this paper is to develop an intelligent event-driven EEG signal acquisition module to achieve an efficient solution for epileptic seizure detection. The suggested method acquires the signal with an event-driven A/D converter (EDADC). The output of EDADC is passed through the activity selection and interpolation blocks. It allows focusing only on the important signal parts and resampling it uniformly. The autoregressive (AR) Burg modelling is employed to extract the features. Afterwards, the extracted features are utilized by C4.5 and NBTree classification techniques. The event-driven feature enables to adapt the system processing load according to the signal temporal variations. This interesting feature of the devised system aptitudes a drastic reduction in its processing activity and therefore in the power consumption as compared to the traditional ones. A comparison of the performance of different classifiers is also made in terms of accuracy. Results show that the proposed system is a potential candidate for an automated epileptic seizure detection. © 2019 The Authors.

202,Q24ZRYKI,journalArticle,2019,"Choubey, H.; Pandey, A.",A new feature extraction and classification mechanisms For EEG signal processing,Multidimensional Systems and Signal Processing,,09236082 (ISSN),"The Electroencephalogram (EEG) signal processing is one of the extensively used research field in recent days, in which the epileptic seizure detection and classification plays an essential role. It is very hard to determine the network of EEG signal, because it contains enormous and fluctuated information about the actions of the brain. Therefore, the earlier research works focused to detect the seizure based on its features. For this reason, it implemented various feature extraction, feature selection, and classification algorithms during the abnormality prediction. But, it has the major drawbacks of inefficient classification results, utilizing large amount of features, and increased complexity. To solve these problems, this paper aims to develop a Masking and Check-in based Feature Extraction Technique (MCFET) and an integrated K-Means with K-Nearest Neighbor classification algorithms for detecting whether the EEG signal is normal or abnormal. Initially, the features of the signal such as Signal to Noise Ratio, variance, and Standard Deviation are extracted by generating the mask value based on the check-in function. After that, the extracted features are given as the input for classification, where both the Euclidean distance and Chebyshev distance are computed. Based on the minimum similarity value, the signal is classified as normal, or abnormal (i.e. interictal or ictal). In experiments, the performance of the proposed MCFET with modified k-NN are evaluated by using different performance measures. Also, the superiority of the technique is proved by comparing it with some existing techniques. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s11045-018-0628-7,10.1007/s11045-018-0628-7,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85057953251&doi=10.1007%2fs11045-018-0628-7&partnerID=40&md5=d99618770fbbf1936eb62fb0ed0b3f6e,2019,28/03/2024 1:15,28/03/2024 1:15,,1793-1809,,4,30,,Multidimens Syst Signal Proc,,,,,,,,English,,,Scopus,,,,,"<p>ASReview_relevant</p>; <p>Export Date: 13 February 2024; Cited By: 10; Correspondence Address: H.

Fotiadis,EEG epileptic seizure detection using k-means clustering and marginal spectrum based on ensemble empirical mode decomposition,13th IEEE International Conference on BioInformatics and BioEngineering,,,The detection of epileptic seizures is of primary interest for the diagnosis of patients with epilepsy. Epileptic seizure is a phenomenon of rhythmicity discharge for either a focal area or the entire brain and this individual behavior usually lasts from seconds to minutes. The unpredictable and rare occurrences of epileptic seizures make the automated detection of them highly recommended especially in long term EEG recordings. The present work proposes an automated method to detect the epileptic seizures by using an unsupervised method based on k-means clustering end Ensemble Empirical Decomposition (EEMD). EEG segments are obtained from a publicly available dataset and are classified in two categories “seizure” and “non-seizure”. Using EEMD the Marginal Spectrum (MS) of each one of the EEG segments is calculated. The MS is then divided into equal intervals and the averages of these intervals are used as input features for k-Means clustering. The evaluation results are very promising indicating overall accuracy 98% and is comparable with other related studies. An advantage of this method that no training data are used due to the unsupervised nature of k-Means clustering.,https://doi.org/10.1109/BIBE.2013.6701528,10.1109/BIBE.2013.6701528,,10/11/2013,28/03/2024 1:15,28/03/2024 1:15,,1-Apr,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,<p>ASReview_relevant</p>,,,Electroencephalography; Feature extraction; Time-frequency analysis; Artificial neural networks; Accuracy; Transforms; Educational institutions,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,13th IEEE International Conference on BioInformatics and BioEngineering,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Yes,,,,Include,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Ming,Continuous Seizure Detection Based on Transformer and Long-Term iEEG,IEEE Journal of Biomedical and Health Informatics,,2168-2208,"Automatic seizure detection algorithms are necessary for patients with refractory epilepsy. Many excellent algorithms have achieved good results in seizure detection. Still, most of them are based on discontinuous intracranial electroencephalogram (iEEG) and ignore the impact of different channels on detection. This study aimed to evaluate the proposed algorithm using continuous, long-term iEEG to show its applicability in clinical routine. In this study, we introduced the ability of the transformer network to calculate the attention between the channels of input signals into seizure detection. We proposed an end-to-end model that included convolution and transformer layers. The model did not need feature engineering or format transformation of the original multi-channel time series. Through evaluation on two datasets, we demonstrated experimentally that the transformer layer could improve the performance of the seizure detection algorithm. For the SWEC-ETHZ iEEG dataset, we achieved 97.5% event-based sensitivity, 0.06/h FDR, and 13.7 s latency. For the TJU-HH iEEG dataset, we achieved 98.1% event-based sensitivity, 0.22/h FDR, and 9.9 s latency. In addition, statistics showed that the model allocated more attention to the channels close to the seizure onset zone within 20 s after the seizure onset, which improved the explainability of the model.

The automatic detection and classification of epileptic EEG signals has great clinical significance. This paper proposes a novel method for epileptic seizure detection using empirical mode decomposition (EMD) and sparse representation based classification (SRC). Firstly, EMD was used to decompose EEG into multiple Intrinsic Mode Function (IMF) components. Secondly, the features like variation coefficient, fluctuation index, relative energy and relative amplitude were extracted from the IMFs. Finally, in the framework of sparse representation based classification (SRC), the feature vectors of test sample were represented as a linear combination of the feature vector of training samples with sparse coefficients. Experimental results show that the time consumed by one epileptic EEG test sample is not more than 5.9 s, and the accuracy is up to 97.5%. In SRC, the raw EEG signals were replaced by extracted features, which could reduce data dimension and computational cost. The algorithm has a good performance in the recognition of ictal EEG. The higher recognition rate and fast speed make the method suit for the diagnosis of epilepsy in clinical application. © Springer International Publishing AG 2017.",https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-59081-3_60,10.1007/978-3-319-59081-3_60,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85021715764&doi=10.1007%2f978-3-319-59081-3_60&partnerID=40&md5=1fc71931ccc263ddded9efe81bd08258,2017,28/03/2024 1:15,28/03/2024 1:15,,516-523,,,10262 LNCS,,,,,,,,Springer Verlag,,English,,,Scopus,,,,,"<p>ASReview_relevant</p>; <p>Export Date: 13 February 2024; Cited By: 1; Correspondence Address: Q.

Commun., ICCC",978-153868339-2 (ISBN),,"Electroencephalography (EEG) is an important tool in epilepsy diagnosis practice. Many computer-based EEG analysis methods have been presented in the literature. Most of them addressed automatic classification of EEG recorded from epilepsy patients. In our previous work, a novel visualization tool for epilepsy EEG was introduced to investigate the focus based on Ensemble Empirical Mode Decomposition (EEMD) and Linear Discriminate Analysis (LDA). As well, two contours were rendered to highlight the focus of spike and seizure EEG respectively. However, it segmented EEG records into 2-second epochs and classified them independently. Some seizure epochs were falsely classified into normal. In this study, we consider EEG records continuously. The 8-second EEG in front of the current epoch is also taken into consideration. More features are extracted. Instead of using a greedy search for important features, as done in the previous work, a genetic algorithm with enforced reduction is adopted. The EEG used in this study was collected from six subjects (two normal and four with epilepsy) in National Taiwan University Hospital (NTHU). The classification accuracy is significantly enhanced. Furthermore, contours for the spike and seizure are merged into one. It is much easier for clinicians and nurses to locate the seizure focus. © 2018 IEEE.",https://doi.org/10.1109/CompComm.2018.8780973,10.1109/CompComm.2018.8780973,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85070830977&doi=10.1109%2fCompComm.2018.8780973&partnerID=40&md5=ad3c2b73bc6debec1a44c284633f47b2,2018,28/03/2024 1:15,28/03/2024 1:15,,1202-1207,,,,,,,,,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,English,,,Scopus,,,,,"<p>ASReview_relevant</p>; <p>Export Date: 13 February 2024; Cited By: 0; Correspondence Address: J.-W.

The EEG of an epileptic patient can last from minutes to many hours and the goal here is to automatically detect the seizures that occurr during the EEG recording. In other words, the goal is to automatically discriminate between the interictal and ictal states of the brain so that the neurologist can immediately focus on the ictal states with no need of detecting such events manually. In particular, the attention is focused on absence seizures. The goal is to develop a system that is able to extract meaningful features from the EEG and to learn how to classify the brain states accordingly. The complexity of the EEG is considered a key feature when dealing with an epileptic brain and two measures of complexity are here estimated and compared in the task of interictal-ictal states discrimination: Approximate Entropy (ApEn) and Permutation Entropy (PE). A Learning Vector Quantization network is then fed with ApEn and PE and trained.

However multi-channel epilepsy EEG signals reflect significant nonlinearity with different degrees of cross-talk among channels, which further leads to high dimensional features extracted from EEG. These shortcomings make the performance of epilepsy detection with machine learning difficult to improve. In order to get fast and accurate detection performance, a feature dimension reduction algorithm based on epilepsy locality preserving projections (E-LPP) is proposed. E-LPP, by preserving the low-dimensional manifold as much as possible, enables to analyze signals of non-linear, non-stationary and high-dimensional nature. To get the best performance, we determine the hyperparameters of E-LPP by grid search. Subsequently a fusion epilepsy detection framework combined feature extraction with E-LPP is proposed to classify whether subjects’ seizure onset or not. We test our method on two well-known and widely studied datasets which includes ictal and interictal EEG recordings. The experimental result on recall, precision and F1 is superior to the common traditional dimensionality reduction algorithm, manifold learning algorithm and autoencoder based deep learning, which indicates this proposed method not only makes it possible to solve nonlinearity and cross-talk among channels in EEG, but also tackles the inherent difficulties regarding unbalanced epilepsy data with high metrics. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s11042-020-09135-7,10.1007/s11042-020-09135-7,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85086791049&doi=10.1007%2fs11042-020-09135-7&partnerID=40&md5=b11890505e150e4da1d22a6179a41997,2021,28/03/2024 1:15,28/03/2024 1:15,,30261-30282,,20,80,,Multimedia Tools Appl,,,,,,,,English,,,Scopus,,,,,"<p>ASReview_relevant</p>; <p>Export Date: 13 February 2024; Cited By: 20; Correspondence Address: H.

In addition, the automatic identification of brain conditions can be helpful in eye-brain-computer interface. That is why during these last few decades, many researchers focused on the development of classification systems for the automatic analysis and detection of epileptic seizures and eye states, which then can be integrated into implantable devices intended to detect the onset of seizures and trigger a focal treatment to block or suppress the seizures progression and to improve the living conditions of patients. In this impetus, this work aims to develop a novel automated classification system which can be performed to detect and identify whether electroencephalogram (EEG) signals belong to epileptic patients in seizure or seizure-free conditions, or to normal individuals with opened or closed eyes. Methods: The proposed classification system consisted of models based on Jacobi polynomial transforms (JPTs). Discrete Legendre transform (DLT) and discrete Chebychev transform (DChT) firstly extract the beta (β) and gamma (γ) rhythms of EEG signals. Thereafter, different measures of complexity are computed from the EEG signals and their extracted rhythms, and applied as inputs of the least-square support vector machine (LS-SVM) classifier with radial basis function (RBF) kernel. Results: The Kruskal-Wallis statistical test is performed and demonstrated that computed JPTs-based measures of complexity sufficiently discriminate EEG signals since their values are significantly higher for seizure EEG signals as compared to those of seizure-free and normal EEG signals with opened or closed eyes. In addition, these measures are used to construct eleven relevant classification problems using the LS-SVM which gained out area under curve (AUC) between 0.983 and 1 which is still proportional to maximum classification accuracies of 88.75% and 100% for normal with opened eyes versus normal with closed eyes, and normal versus seizure or seizure-free versus seizure classification problems, respectively. Conclusion: Overall, it is found that the proposed classification system extends to be less complex for practical applications and can be suitable for automatic epileptic seizures detection and eye states identification. © 2021 The Author(s)",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.imu.2021.100536,10.1016/j.imu.2021.100536,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85101655474&doi=10.1016%2fj.imu.2021.100536&partnerID=40&md5=6c8879d2d04805fe9a5792b143aea39f,2021,28/03/2024 1:15,28/03/2024 1:15,,,,,23,,Inform.

In the world, many of the people are suffering from epileptic seizures. Due to variety of seizure classes, there is a difficulty to provide specific solution. Epileptic seizure patients face unpredictable problems that may occur at any time. This paper uses machine learning approaches for the detection of epilepsy seizures using EEG signals. Multiple prominent approaches like artificial neural network (ANN), K-nearest neighbor (KNN), and convolutional neural networks (CNN) have been used to detect different classes of seizures. The benchmark dataset of UCI’s EEG time series seizure detection dataset has been used. An extensive simulations-based study has been done to understand the behavior of the dataset. Based on experimental results, it has been observed that the designed CNN has achieved the highest accuracy of 99.39% among the used different techniques. In comparison with other deep neural networks such as recurrent networks (RNN), long short-term memory (LSTM) in the literature, the used CNN has gained comparative results with less complexity in terms of network parameters and training time. Also, for the ease of patients, we have designed a mobile-based automated system for seizure detection. React native and nodejs have been used to implement frontend and backend of the system, respectively. The application is useful for different diseases detection and maintains health records such as blood pressure, ECG, and temperature and also to improve manual or visualization methods to give stress-free life to patients and their families. © 2021, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.",https://doi.org/10.1007/978-981-15-8025-3_31,10.1007/978-981-15-8025-3_31,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85101557921&doi=10.1007%2f978-981-15-8025-3_31&partnerID=40&md5=1bdf71aac03d130c92d1244edf7c7d99,2021,28/03/2024 1:15,28/03/2024 1:15,,309-314,,,,,,,,,,,Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH,,English,,,Scopus,,,,,"<p>ASReview_relevant</p>; <p>Export Date: 13 February 2024; Cited By: 0; Correspondence Address: S.

The goal is to extract the seizure sections with a high accuracy to ease the Neurologist's burden of inspecting such long-term EEG data. We aim to achieve this using the minimum feedback from the Neurologist. To accomplish this, we use the majority of the state-of-the-art features proposed in this domain for evolving a collective network of binary classifiers (CNBC) using multi-dimensional particle swarm optimization (MD PSO). Multiple CNBCs are then used to form a CNBC ensemble (CNBC-E), which aggregates epileptic seizure frames from the classification map of each CNBC in order to maximize the sensitivity rate. Finally, a morphological filter forms the final epileptic segments while filtering out the outliers in the form of classification noise. The proposed system is fully generic, which does not require any a priori information about the patient such as the list of relevant EEG channels. The results of the classification experiments, which are performed over the benchmark CHB-MIT scalp long-term EEG database show that the proposed system can achieve all the aforementioned objectives and exhibits a significantly superior performance compared to several other state-of-the-art methods. Using a limited training dataset that is formed by less than 2. min of seizure and 24. min of non-seizure data on the average taken from the early 25% section of the EEG record of each patient, the proposed system establishes an average sensitivity rate above 89% along with an average specificity rate above 93% over the test set. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jbi.2014.02.005,10.1016/j.jbi.2014.02.005,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84902551300&doi=10.1016%2fj.jbi.2014.02.005&partnerID=40&md5=0ccdb14014cf7b94feb1933773c2980d,2014,28/03/2024 1:15,28/03/2024 1:15,,16-31,,,49,,J.

The electroencephalogram (EEG) is a diagnostic test used to analyze brain activity in various neurological conditions including epilepsy and interpreted by the clinician for appropriate diagnosis. However, the process of EEG analysis for diagnosis can be automated using machine learning algorithms (MLAs) to aid the clinician. The objective of the study was to test different algorithms that could be used for the detection of seizures. Materials and Methods Video EEG (vEEG) was collected from subjects diagnosed to have episodes of seizures. The epilepsy dataset thus obtained was subjected to empirical mode decomposition (EMD) and the signal was decomposed into intrinsic mode functions (IMFs). The first five levels of decomposition were considered for analysis as per the established protocol. Statistical features such as interquartile range (IQR), entropy, and mean absolute deviation (MAD) were extracted from these IMFs. Results In this study, different MLAs such as nearest neighbor (NN), naïve Bayes (NB), and support vector machines (SVMs) were used to distinguish between normal (interictal) and abnormal (ictal) states. The demonstrated accuracy rates were 97.32% for NN, 99.02% for NB, and 93.75% for SVM. Conclusion Based on this accuracy and sensitivity, it may be posited that the NB classifier provides significantly better results for the detection of abnormal signals indicating that MLA can detect the seizure with better accuracy. © 2018 Indian Epilepsy Society.",https://doi.org/10.1055/s-0039-1693072,10.1055/s-0039-1693072,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85070251560&doi=10.1055%2fs-0039-1693072&partnerID=40&md5=483c7a34ff4be37b65989a63cb266d91,2018,28/03/2024 1:15,28/03/2024 1:15,,92-98,,2,5,,Int.

Many methods and algorithms that can detect seizures in epileptic patients have been proposed. Electroencephalogram (EEG) is one of helpful tools for investigating epilepsy forms in patients, however, an expert in the neurological field must perform a visual inspection to identify a seizure. Such analyses require longer time because of the huge dataset recorded from many electrodes which are put on the human scalp. With the non-stationary nature of EEG, especially during the abnormality periods, entropy measures gain more interest in the field. In this work, by exploring the advantages of both reliable state-of-the-art entropies, fuzzy entropy and distribution entropy, a modified-Distribution entropy (mDistEn) for epilepsy detection is proposed. As the results, the proposed mDistEn method can successfully achieve the same consistency and better accuracy than using the state-of-the-art entropies. The mDistEn corresponds to higher Area Under the Curve (AUC) values compared with the fuzzy entropy and the distribution entropy and yields 92% classification accuracy. © Copyright © 2020 Aung and Wongsawat.",https://doi.org/10.3389/fphys.2020.00607,10.3389/fphys.2020.00607,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85087685298&doi=10.3389%2ffphys.2020.00607&partnerID=40&md5=e8698900caee7859c07b5877a361c78a,2020,28/03/2024 1:15,28/03/2024 1:15,,,,,11,,Front.

Syst. Technol.,21903018 (ISSN); 978-981167995-7 (ISBN),,"Epilepsy is the most common neurological disorder that has affected 50 million worldwide population. Epilepsy is a chronic condition that is characterized as recurrent and unprovoked seizures. A seizure is defined as abnormal, excessive paroxysmal discharge of the cerebral neurons. In general, epilepsy evaluation, the high time resolution (~1–2 ms) electrophysiological data recorded using electroencephalography (EEG) is commonly used. The EEG data are visually inspected for epileptic seizure instances. However, the manual interpretation may lead to subjective error-causing misdiagnosis, and identifying the seizure instances in high temporal resolution data may be time-consuming. To mitigate these problems, the proposed study uses a hand-crafted deep learning model to classify the epileptic and non-epileptic EEG data. This study used EEG data acquired from two databases—University of Bonn and Physiobank Children’s Hospital Boston—Massachusetts Institute of Technology (CHB-MIT). We split the EEG data in 80:20 ratio for training and testing the model. The model was trained under three network specifications, which were designed based on the number of high-level features and low-level features. The result showed that the proposed study successfully classified epileptic and non-epileptic signals with the accuracy of 67% and 92% for University of Bonn data and CHB-MIT EEG data, respectively, for the network specification which had a high number of low-level features. We tested the model for optimal value of number of epochs (20) and learning rate (0.001). The study shows that the MIT-CHB data are suitable for classification as they have a good number of samples and balanced epileptic and non-epileptic signals. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.",https://doi.org/10.1007/978-981-16-7996-4_30,10.1007/978-981-16-7996-4_30,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85125243227&doi=10.1007%2f978-981-16-7996-4_30&partnerID=40&md5=694a740ff5ae7de3eb9862379f9e6b0c,2022,28/03/2024 1:15,28/03/2024 1:15,,425-435,,,269,,,,,,,,Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH,,English,,,Scopus,,,,,"<p>ASReview_relevant</p>; <p>Export Date: 13 February 2024; Cited By: 0; Correspondence Address: K.A.

Electroencephalogram (EEG) signals play a critical role in the diagnosis of epilepsy. Multichannel EEGs contain more information than do single-channel EEGs. Automatic detection algorithms for spikes or seizures have traditionally been implemented on single-channel EEG, and algorithms for multichannel EEG are unavailable.Methodology:This study proposes a physiology-based detection system for epileptic seizures that uses multichannel EEG signals. The proposed technique was tested on two EEG data sets acquired from 18 patients. Both unipolar and bipolar EEG signals were analyzed. We employed sample entropy (SampEn), statistical values, and concepts used in clinical neurophysiology (e.g., phase reversals and potential fields of a bipolar EEG) to extract the features. We further tested the performance of a genetic algorithm cascaded with a support vector machine and post-classification spike matching.Principal Findings:We obtained 86.69% spike detection and 99.77% seizure detection for Data Set I. The detection system was further validated using the model trained by Data Set I on Data Set II.

The most common way to detect seizures automatically is to use an electroencephalogram (EEG). Many studies have used feature extraction that needs time for calculation. In this study, sliding discrete Fourier transform (SDFT) was applied for conversion to a frequency domain without using a window, which was compared with using window for feature selection. SDFT was calculated for each time series sample directly without any delay by using a simple infinite impulse response (IIR) structure. The EEG database of Bonn University was used to test the proposed method, and two cases were defined to examine a two-classifier feedforward neural network and an adaptive network-based fuzzy inference system. Results revealed that the maximum accuracies were 93% without delay and 99.8% with a one-second delay.

Classification based on EEG-related features can be used to detect brain-related diseases, especially epilepsy. The quality of EEG-related features is directly related to the performance of automated epileptic seizure detection. Therefore, finding prominent features bears importance in the study of automated epileptic seizure detection. In this paper, a novel method is proposed to automatically detect epileptic seizure. This work proposes a novel time-frequency-domain feature named global volatility index (GVIX) to measure holistic signal fluctuation in wavelet coefficients and original time-series signals. Afterwards, the multi-attribute EEG feature pool is constructed by combining time-frequency-domain features, time-domain features, nonlinear features, and entropy-based features. Minimum redundancy maximum relevance (mRMR) is then introduced to select the most prominent features. Results in this study indicate that this method performs better than others for epileptic seizure detection using an identical dataset, and that our proposed GVIX is a prominent feature in automated epileptic seizure detection. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-22744-9_4,10.1007/978-3-030-22744-9_4,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85067816502&doi=10.1007%2f978-3-030-22744-9_4&partnerID=40&md5=3178a7194999fa306ae1beca7a59731b,2019,28/03/2024 1:15,28/03/2024 1:15,,45-59,,,11538 LNCS,,,,,,,,Springer Verlag,,English,,,Scopus,,,,,"<p>ASReview_relevant</p>; <p>Export Date: 13 February 2024; Cited By: 3; Correspondence Address: Y.

In this study, a method based on an improved wavelet neural network (WNN) is proposed for automatic seizure detection in long-term intracranial EEG. WNN combines the traditional back propagation neural network (BPNN) with wavelet transform. Compared with classic WNN architectures, a modified point symmetry-based fuzzy c-means (MSFCM) algorithm is applied to the initialization of wavelet transform's translations, which has been successful in multiclass cancer classification. In addition, Fast-decaying Morlet wavelet is chosen as the activation function to make the WNN learn faster. Relative amplitude and relative fluctuation index are extracted as a feature vector to describe the variation of EEG signals, and the feature vector is then fed into WNN for classification. At last, post-processing including smoothing, channel fusion and collar technique is adopted to achieve more accurate and stable results. This system performs efficiently with the average sensitivity of 96.72%, specificity of 98.91% and false-detection rate of 0.27 h-1.

After preprocessing of EEG signals we extract representative features in time, frequency and time-frequency domain as well as using non-linear analysis. The features are extracted in a few frequency sub-bands of clinical interest since these sub-bands showed much better discriminatory characteristics compared with the whole frequency band. Then we optimally reduce the dimension of feature space to two using scatter matrices. A decision about the presence of epileptiform activity in EEG signals is made by quadratic classifiers designed in the reduced two-dimensional feature space. The accuracy of the technique was tested on three sets of electroencephalographic (EEG) signals recorded at the University Hospital Bonn: surface EEG signals from healthy volunteers, intracranial EEG signals from the epilepsy patients during the seizure free interval from within the seizure focus and intracranial EEG signals of epileptic seizures also from within the seizure focus. An overall detection accuracy of 98.7% was achieved. © 2015 Gajic, Djurovic, Gligorijevic, Di Gennaro and Savic-Gajic.",https://doi.org/10.3389/fncom.2015.00038,10.3389/fncom.2015.00038,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84927642979&doi=10.3389%2ffncom.2015.00038&partnerID=40&md5=4c90685ac25747d89dd04dd790bb22e0,2015,28/03/2024 1:15,28/03/2024 1:15,,,,MAR,9,,Front.

One is the degree centrality combined with the linear features as the features to classify the epileptic EEG signal. Firstly, we transformed the time series into complex network by using horizontal visibility graph (HVG). Then we extracted the degree centrality of the complex network combined with the fluctuation index and variation coefficient as the three-dimensional features and the classification accuracy is up to 95.98%. To enhance the difference of the degree centrality feature, we put the other new feature.

The automatic detection and diagnosis system of epilepsy based on electroencephalogram (EEG) is of great significance to help patients with epilepsy return to normal life. With the development of deep learning technology and the increase in the amount of EEG data, the performance of deep learning based automatic detection algorithm for epilepsy EEG has gradually surpassed the traditional hand-crafted approaches. However, the neural architecture design for epilepsy EEG analysis is time-consuming and laborious, and the designed structure is difficult to adapt to the changing EEG collection environment, which limits the application of the epilepsy EEG automatic detection system. In this paper, we explore the possibility of Automated Machine Learning (AutoML) playing a role in the task of epilepsy EEG detection. We apply the neural architecture search (NAS) algorithm in the AutoKeras platform to design the model for epilepsy EEG analysis and utilize feature interpretability methods to ensure the reliability of the searched model. The experimental results show that the model obtained through NAS outperforms the baseline model in performance. The searched model improves classification accuracy, F1-score and Cohen’s kappa coefficient by 7.68%, 7.82% and 9.60% respectively than the baseline model.

Clinically, epileptic seizures are usually detected via the continuous monitoring of electroencephalogram (EEG) signals by experienced neurophysiologists. OBJECTIVE: In order to detect epileptic seizures automatically with a satisfactory precision, a new method is proposed which defines hybrid features that could characterize the epileptiform waves and classify single-channel EEG signals. METHODS: The hybrid features consist of both the ones usually used in EEG signal analysis and the Kraskov entropy based on Hilbert-Huang Transform which is proposed for the first time. With the hybrid features, EEG signals are classified and the epileptic seizures are detected. RESULTS: Three datasets are used for test on three binary-classification problems defined by clinical requirements for epileptic seizures detection. Experimental results show that the accuracy, sensitivity and specificity of the proposed methods outperform two state-of-the-art methods, especially on the databases containing signals from different sources.

Instead of extracting features from the EEG signal, first the EEG signal is filtered by a prediction error filter (PEF) to compute a prediction error signal. A two-level wavelet decomposition of the prediction error signal leads to two detail signals and one approximate signal. Eight features are extracted every one second using a 2-second window with a 50% overlap. These features are input to two different types of classifiers: a linear support vector machine (SVM) classifier and an AdaBoost classifier. The algorithm is tested using the intra-cranial EEG (iEEG) from the Freiburg database. It is shown that the proposed algorithm can achieve a sensitivity of 95.0% and an average false positive rate (FPR) of 0.124 per hour, using the linear SVM classifier. The AdaBoost classifier achieves a sensitivity of 98.75% and an average FPR of 0.075 per hour. These results are obtained with leave-one-out cross-validation.

High frequency (80-500. Hz) activity has recently been shown to be prominent in the intracranial EEG of epileptic patients but has not been used in seizure detection. The purpose of this study is to investigate if these frequencies can contribute to seizure detection. The system was designed using 30. h of intracranial EEG, including 15 seizures in 15 patients. Wavelet decomposition, feature extraction, adaptive thresholding and artifact removal were employed in training data. An EMG removal algorithm was developed based on two features: Lack of correlation between frequency bands and energy-spread in frequency. Results based on the analysis of testing data (36. h of intracranial EEG, including 18 seizures) show a sensitivity of 72%, a false detection of 0.7/h and a median delay of 5.7. s. Missed seizures originated mainly from seizures with subtle or absent high frequencies or from EMG removal procedures. False detections were mainly due to weak EMG or interictal high frequency activities. The system performed sufficiently well to be considered for clinical use, despite the exclusive use of frequencies not usually considered in clinical interpretation. High frequencies have the potential to contribute significantly to the detection of epileptic seizures. © 2012.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.medengphy.2012.05.005,10.1016/j.medengphy.2012.05.005,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84874524192&doi=10.1016%2fj.medengphy.2012.05.005&partnerID=40&md5=611a2f28dbdb40649a402fac0aef7b75,2013,28/03/2024 1:15,28/03/2024 1:15,,319-328,,3,35,,Med.

Motivation: Various epileptic seizure prediction methods are introduced for accurately predicting the pre-ictal state of human brain, but to determine the discriminative features poses a major challenge in the medical sector. Hypothesis: Develop a technique for epileptic seizure prediction using electroencephalogram signals that detects the epileptic seizure automatically. Method: In this research, an effective optimization algorithm, named Modified Atom Search Optimization-based Deep Recurrent Neural Network is proposed to perform accurate seizure prediction with less computation time.

Raheel,Towards Classifying Epileptic Seizures Using Entropy Variants,2019 IEEE Fifth International Conference on Big Data Computing Service and Applications (BigDataService),,,"Epilepsy is the second most common neurological disorder, affecting about 50 Million people of the world's population. Entropy is a nonlinear measure suitable for studying chaotic behavior and randomness, suits well to analyze perceptual time series data such as EEG data. However, the EEG data are non-stationary and prone to numerous noise types that badly affect the classification accuracy of epileptic seizures. To address these issues this paper introduces a novel index for classifying epileptic seizure to extract the hidden information from recorded EEG signal to discriminate seizure states. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method shows better anti-noise performance compared to the conventional State of art entropy variants i.e. Approximate Entropy (ApEn), Sample Entropy (SampEn) and Permutation Entropy (PE). Compared to other variants that are quite sensitive to noise, the proposed method maintains its higher accuracy of 95.3% and AUC among the recorded EEG data of 21 subjects. The discriminative abilities of entropy variants were further tested using student t-test. The results on The Freiburg EEG database proved the superiority of the proposed index over the existing state-of-the-art variants. With the excellent classification performance and low computational complexity, PFuzzy entropy can be utilized for practical seizure classification and epilepsy detection in future hardware implementation and also opens future opportunities towards real-time detection and prediction of epileptic seizures.",https://doi.org/10.1109/BigDataService.2019.00052,10.1109/BigDataService.2019.00052,,4/04/2019,28/03/2024 1:15,28/03/2024 1:15,,296-300,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,<p>ASReview_relevant</p>,,,Electroencephalography; Epilepsy; Support vector machines; Electroencephalogram (EEG); Time series analysis; Entropy; Seizure; Indexes; Time measurement; Automatic Seizure Classification; PFuzzy Entropy,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2019 IEEE Fifth International Conference on Big Data Computing Service and Applications (BigDataService),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Yes,,,,Include,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Analyzing the continuing EEG reports manually for a patient affected by epilepsy is time-consuming, and it needs a large storage volume. The proposed paper is based on a unique method for detecting epileptic seizures by Adjustable Analytic Wavelet Transform (AAWT). This work is also focused on testing the practicability of utilizing the Kohonen network maps for predicting the dynamics of the brain states in the form of the trajectory which may provide the occurrence of the seizure event. AAWT is applied on each EEG signal to decompose EEG signals into the sub-band signals. The fractal dimension is applied to these sub-bands signals as a discriminating feature due to its nonlinear chaotic trait.

In past some years, many algorithms have been developed for seizure detection. Traditional method of seizure detection includes manual feature selection and classifier separately. In recent years, convolutional neural network architecture of deep learning gets very much popularity in place of traditional method. Though, very few works of convolutional neural network are found in literature for one dimensional signal classification. However, one dimensional EEG and ECG signal classifications are necessary to detect and investigate diseases like seizure activity, sleep apnea or arrhythmia and so on. The proposed method of one dimensional EEG signal classification for epileptic seizure detection involves the smallest and simplest 1-D convolutional neural network architecture for automated feature selection.

We have approached this issue in the context of online detection of epileptic seizures by developing a DL model from EEG signals, and associating certain properties of the model behavior with the expert medical knowledge. This has conditioned the preparation of the input signals, the network architecture, and the post-processing of the output in line with the domain knowledge. Specifically, we focused the discussion on three main aspects: (1) how to aggregate the classification results on signal segments provided by the DL model into a larger time scale, at the seizure-level; (2) what are the relevant frequency patterns learned in the first convolutional layer of different models, and their relation with the delta, theta, alpha, beta and gamma frequency bands on which the visual interpretation of EEG is based; and (3) the identification of the signal waveforms with larger contribution towards the ictal class, according to the activation differences highlighted using the DeepLIFT method. Results show that the kernel size in the first layer determines the interpretability of the extracted features and the sensitivity of the trained models, even though the final performance is very similar after post-processing. Also, we found that amplitude is the main feature leading to an ictal prediction, suggesting that a larger patient population would be required to learn more complex frequency patterns.

An encephalogram (EEG) is a gold standard method in the detection and analysis of epileptic seizures. However, the standard EEG recording system is too obstructive to be used in daily life. Behind-the-ear EEG is an alternative approach to record EEG conveniently. Previous researchers applied machine learning to automatically detect seizures with EEG, but the epileptic EEG waveform contains subtle changes that are difficult to be identified. Furthermore, the extremely small proportion of ictal events in the long-term monitoring may cause the imbalance problem and, consequently, poor prediction performance in supervised learning approaches. In this study, we present an automatic seizure detection algorithm with a generative adversarial network (GAN) trained by unsupervised learning and evaluated it with behind-the-ear EEG. Methods: We recorded behind-the-ear EEGs from 12 patients who have various types of epilepsy. Data were reviewed separately by two epileptologists, who determined the onsets and ends of seizures. First, we conducted unsupervised learning with the normal records for the GAN to learn the representation of normal states. Second, we performed automatic seizure detection with the trained GAN as an anomaly detector. Last, we combined the Gram matrix with other anomaly losses to improve detection performance. Results: The proposed approach achieved detection performance with an area under the receiver operating curve of 0.939 and sensitivity of 96.3% with a false alarm rate of 0.14 per hour in the test dataset. In addition, we confirmed distinguishability with the distribution of the anomaly scores in terms of EEG frequency bands. Conclusions: It is expected that the proposed anomaly detection via GAN with the behind-the-ear EEG can be effectively used for long-term seizure monitoring in daily life. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cmpb.2020.105472,10.1016/j.cmpb.2020.105472,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85083728151&doi=10.1016%2fj.cmpb.2020.105472&partnerID=40&md5=93da777acbee37e5145d7f0125db06ba,2020,28/03/2024 1:15,28/03/2024 1:15,,,,,193,,Comput.

Notes Electr. Eng.,18761100 (ISSN); 978-981336925-2 (ISBN),,"Epilepsy is diagnosed by assessing the brain signal using an electroencephalograph (EEG). The assessment relies on manual visual inspection, which required experience and years of training. A computer-aided diagnose system can help neurologists assess the EEG signal. This study explores the epileptic condition by decomposing EEG signals using three levels of wavelet packet decomposition (WPD). Three orders of Daubechies mother wavelets are used. Since EEG is a non-stationary biological signal, an entropy measurement using the Shannon entropy is used to extract the signals’ information. The next process is combining the features from all levels of the decomposed signals producing 14 number of features. This study reduces the number of features using the wrapper feature subset selection (WFSS) method. The searching algorithm used is the sequential backward (SBS) and forward (SFS) selection method. The multilayer perceptron neural network (MLPNN) is used for the classification method. The system achieves the highest accuracy of 91% by using seven number of features obtained from WPD(db2) + WFSS(SBS) + MLPNN. The minimum number of features is obtained using WPD(db16) + WFSS(SFS) + MLPNN, which produces six features. While the use of WFSS(SFS) in db16 produces six features with the highest increase of accuracy by 22%. This indicates that the use of WFSS can obtain an optimal number of features set and can improve the system’s performance. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.",https://doi.org/10.1007/978-981-33-6926-9_50,10.1007/978-981-33-6926-9_50,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85105931995&doi=10.1007%2f978-981-33-6926-9_50&partnerID=40&md5=0143188d22a1c99cd33b167c317f081c,2021,28/03/2024 1:15,28/03/2024 1:15,,567-577,,,746 LNEE,,,,,,,,Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH,,English,,,Scopus,,,,,"<p>ASReview_relevant</p>; <p>Export Date: 13 February 2024; Cited By: 0; Correspondence Address: I.

Sci.,03029743 (ISSN); 978-331909329-1 (ISBN),,"Epilepsy is a chronic neurological condition that affects approximately 70 million people worldwide. Characterised by sudden bursts of excess electricity in the brain manifesting as seizures, epilepsy is still not well understood when compared with other neurological disorders. Seizures often happen unexpectedly and attempting to predict them has been a research topic for the last 20 years. Electroencephalograms have been integral to these studies, as they can capture the brain's electrical signals. The challenge is to generalise the detection of seizures in different regions of the brain and across multiple subjects. This paper explores this idea further and presents a supervised machine learning approach that classifies seizure and non-seizure records using an open dataset containing 543 electroencephalogram segments. Our approach posits a new method for generalising seizure detection across different subjects without prior knowledge about the focal point of seizures. Our results show an improvement on existing studies with 88% for sensitivity, 88% for specificity and 93% for the area under the curve, with a 12% global error, using the k-NN classifier. © 2014 Springer International Publishing Switzerland.",https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-09330-7_14,10.1007/978-3-319-09330-7_14,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84958548191&doi=10.1007%2f978-3-319-09330-7_14&partnerID=40&md5=b7bd276c0a96c57f3b7a67941e2ea236,2014,28/03/2024 1:15,28/03/2024 1:15,,112-118,,,8590 LNBI,,,,,,,,Springer Verlag,,English,,,Scopus,,,,,"<p>ASReview_relevant</p>; <p>Export Date: 13 February 2024; Cited By: 10; Conference name: 10th International Conference on Intelligent Computing, ICIC 2014; Conference date: 3 August 2014 through 6 August 2014; Conference code: 106532</p>; Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;8<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;8<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;17",,,Electroencephalography; machine learning; Electroencephalogram; Epileptic seizure detection; Learning systems; Classification (of information); Neurology; Neurological disorders; classification; Classification; Machine learning; Seizure; Bioelectric phenomena; Machine learning approaches; Supervised machine learning; Area under the curves; Bioinformatics; Intelligent computing; Over sampling; Oversampling; Non-seizure; PREDICTION; non-seizure; oversampling,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Yes,,,,Include,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Visual inspection of encephalography (EEG) recorded by sensing devices is the common practice in detection of epilespsy.But, this approach requires long time inspection which is laborious and burden for a neurologist and in turns degrade the performances. Also, brain stimulation is an emerging technology for the diagnosis of many neurological problem such as epilepsy, dementia. The modern invention of electroencephalogram (EEG) signals recorder makes easy to interpret brain signals automatically for extraction of discriminating pattern of signals. So, automatic seizure detection by EEG recordings could replace the visual inspection. Therefore, this paper presents a model to detect epilepsy by recording EEG signals. The approach is based on signal processing in time frequency domain by multilevel Discrete Wavelet Transformation (DWT) and nonlinear Artificial Neural Network (ANN) model. Statistical features are considered to level the EEG signals. Then, the ANN model is trained, validated and tested. To validate the model, it is benchmarked on an epilepsy dataset recorded by the University of Bonn. By showing remarkable accuracy in predicting EEG signals of three classes such as normal, inter-ictal and ictal, the proposed model proves the prevalence.

Recognizing seizure signals in intelligent way is quite important in clinical diagnosis of Epileptic seizure. Various traditional and deep machine learning techniques are employed for this purpose. However, the Epileptic seizure prediction and classification performance is not satisfactory over small EEG dataset using traditional approaches. The Transfer learning approach overcomes this by reusing the pre-trained networks such as googlenet, resnet101 and vgg19 trained on large Image database. This experiment has been done in two phases: (1) RGB image dataset generated for the seizure and non-seizure EEG signals data of University of Bonn using a novel preprocessing technique, (2) we configured googlenet, resnet101 and vgg19 trained networks to learn a new pattern or features from the RGB image Dataset and finally, above mentioned networks have been used for the classification. The use of Vgg19 network shows greater accuracy among the three but takes comparatively more prediction time. We will mainly emphasize on the results obtained from the googlenet, since it provides effective accuracy taking less time for prediction. The proposed method achieved an accuracy of above 99% for a smaller number of epochs and maximum accuracy of 100% when we increase number of epochs. Experimental outcomes show the proposed approach using googlent achieved better performance w.r.t to many state-of-the-art classification algorithms even on the small EEG dataset.

However, the efficient extraction and effective selection of informative EEG features is crucial in assisting clinicians to diagnose epilepsy accurately. In this paper, a determinant of covariance matrix (Cov–Det) model is suggested for reducing EEG dimensionality. First, EEG signals are segmented into intervals using a sliding window technique. Then, Cov–Det is applied to each interval. To construct a features vector, a set of statistical features are extracted from each interval. To eliminate redundant features, the Kolmogorov–Smirnov (KST) and Mann–Whitney U (MWUT) tests are integrated, the extracted features ranked based on KST and MWUT metrics, and arithmetic operators are adopted to construe the most pertinent classified features for each pair in the EEG signal group. The selected features are then fed into the proposed AdaBoost Back-Propagation neural network (AB_BP_NN) to effectively classify EEG signals into seizure and free seizure segments. Finally, the AB_BP_NN is compared with several classical machine learning techniques; the results demonstrate that the proposed mode of AB_BP_NN provides insignificant false positive rates, simpler design, and robustness in classifying epileptic signals. Two datasets, the Bern–Barcelona and Bonn datasets, are used for performance evaluation. The proposed technique achieved an average accuracy of 100% and 98.86%, respectively, for the Bern–Barcelona and Bonn datasets, which is considered a noteworthy improvement compared to the current state-of-the-art methods. © 2021 by the authors.

In the brain, epilepsy manifests as a condition that is marked by repeated, unpremeditated fits and other related problems, and epileptic seizures are hard to predict. The electroencephalogram (EEG) has evolved into an effective diagnostic tool for epilepsy and subsequent epileptic seizures. Visually analyzing an EEG chart helps determine seizures' duration and location. But it's time-consuming. To remedy this issue, we have developed a deep learning model-based framework. In this study, an EEG-based dataset is utilized to test and verify the binary classification tasks to predict and classify whether a patient is having an epileptic seizure. It is proposed to implement a deep learning-based multimodel ensemble model to be able to classify and identify EEG recordings showing or not epileptic seizures from EEG signals. The deep learning models considered are CNN, LSTM, and BiLSTM models, and the proposed ensemble model is composed of these three trained models with their best weights during training. The performance of these models is evaluated and compared by utilizing different metric analyses such as precision, recall, specificity, accuracy, and F1-score.

We utilized the EEG data from 29 seizures of 18 patients who underwent multi-day video-scalp EEG monitoring as part of their presurgical evaluation. Seven time domain measures - signal energy, approximate entropy (ApEn), sample entropy (SampEn), mean, variance, skewness and kurtosis were calculated for each windowed signal. Among them, signal energy was selected as significant feature to discriminate normal and seizure condition. The performance of five classifiers - Linear Discriminant Algorithm (LDA), Naive Bayes (NB), Decision Tree (DT), Support Vector Machine (SVM) and k-Nearest Neighbour (KNN) using signal energy feature were analysed to test the suitability for automated seizure detection. Among the five, LDA and NB classifiers detected the unknown samples with sensitivity (specificity) of 44% (95%), 54% (90%) respectively. The other two, DT and KNN classifiers performed with sensitivity (specificity) of 74% (73%), and 74% (67%) respectively.

The objective of the work is to explore a feasible approach for patient-specific seizure detection in long-term electroencephalogram (EEG) recordings. For this purpose, a novel method based on nonlinear mode decomposition (NMD) has been proposed in this study. A sliding window is used on the multi-channel EEG, where four selected channels have been segmented into a series of successive short epochs with a 2-s duration. Then, the EEG is decomposed into a set of nonlinear modes (NMs) by the NMD algorithm and one type of statistical parameter named fractional central moment (FCM) is calculated over the first two NMs constituting the input feature vector to be fed to three common classifiers. The proposed features, when using K nearest neighbor (KNN), are able to detect seizures with high sensitivity values across all patients consistently. We have explored the ability of the FCM in NMD domain for classification of seizure and non-seizure EEG signals. Our approach has achieved the average sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy values as 98.40%, 99.10%, and 98.61%, respectively, over all the data groups on CHB-MIT database. The experimental results have indicated that the proposed method is not only quite reliable in diagnosing seizure with single type of feature yielding satisfied performance but also robust to variations of seizure types among patients. In this regard, it can be expected that our proposed method is endowed with promising prospects for the use of an expert software application in real-time automated seizure detection.

According to the world health organization, epilepsy is characterized by repetitive seizures and more electrical discharge in a group of brain neurons results in sudden physical actions. The aim of this paper is to introduce a new method to classify epileptic phases based on Fourier synchro-squeezed transform (FSST) of electroencephalogram (EEG) signals. FSST is a time-frequency (TF) analysis and provides sharper TF estimates than the conventional short-time Fourier transform (STFT). Absolute of FSST of EEG signal is computed and segmented into five non-overlapping frequency sub-bands as delta (delta), theta (theta), alpha (alpha), beta (beta), and gamma (gamma). Each sub-band is considered as a gray-scale image and then we propose to obtain the gray-level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM) of each sub-band as features. We concatenate the features of different sub-bands to obtain the final feature vector. After selecting informative features by infinite latent feature selection (ILFS) method, the support vector machine (SVM) and K-nearest neighbor (KNN) classifiers are used separately to classify EEG signals. We use the EEG signals from Bonn University database and different combinations of its sets are considered. Simulation results show that the proposed method efficiently classifies the EEG signals and can be used to determine the phase of epilepsy.

The proposed scheme consists of two sequential steps: detecting seizure episodes from long EEG recordings, and determining seizure onsets and offsets of the detected episodes. We introduce a neural network-based model called ScoreNet to carry out the second step by better predicting the seizure probability of pre-detected seizure epochs to determine seizure onsets and offsets. A cost function called log-dice loss with a similar meaning to the F1 score is proposed to handle the natural data imbalance inherent in EEG signals signifying seizure events. ScoreNet is then verified on the CHB-MIT Scalp EEG database in combination with several classifiers including random forest, convolutional neural network (CNN), and logistic regression. As a result, ScoreNet improves seizure detection performance over lone epoch-based seizure classification methods; F1 scores increase significantly from 16–37% to 53–70%, and false positive rates per hour decrease from 0.53–5.24 to 0.05–0.61. This method provides clinically acceptable latencies of detecting seizure onset and offset of less than 10 seconds. In addition, an effective latency index is proposed as a metric for detection latency whose scoring considers undetected events to provide better insight into onset and offset detection than conventional time-based metrics.",https://doi.org/10.1109/TNSRE.2021.3129467,10.1109/TNSRE.2021.3129467,,2021,28/03/2024 1:15,28/03/2024 1:15,,2474-2483,,,29,,IEEE Transactions on Neural Systems and Rehabilitation Engineering,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,<p>ASReview_relevant</p>,,,EEG; Deep learning; Electroencephalography; Convolutional neural networks; Scalp; Feature extraction; Brain modeling; Detectors; Logic gates; EL-index; ScoreNet; seizure onset and offset detection,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Yes,,,,Include,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Shang,Seizure Onset Detection Using Empirical Mode Decomposition and Common Spatial Pattern,IEEE Transactions on Neural Systems and Rehabilitation Engineering,,1558-0210,"Automatic seizure onset detection plays an important role in epilepsy diagnosis. In this paper, a novel seizure onset detection method is proposed by combining empirical mode decomposition (EMD) of long-term scalp electroencephalogram (EEG) with common spatial pattern (CSP). First, wavelet transform (WT) and EMD are employed on EEG recordings respectively for filtering pre-processing and time-frequency decomposition. Then CSP is applied to reduce the dimension of multi-channel time-frequency representation, and the variance is extracted as the only feature. Afterwards, a support vector machine (SVM) group consisting of ten SVMs is served as a robust classifier. Finally, the post-processing is adopted to acquire a higher recognition rate and reduce the false detection rate. The results obtained from CHB-MIT database of 977 h scalp EEG recordings reveal that the proposed system can achieve a segment-based sensitivity of 97.34% with a specificity of 97.50% and an event-based sensitivity of 98.47% with a false detection rate of 0.63/h. This proposed detection system was also validated on a clinical scalp EEG database from the Second Hospital of Shandong University, and the system yielded a sensitivity of 93.67% and a specificity of 96.06%. At the event-based level, a sensitivity of 99.39% and a false detection rate of 0.64/h were obtained. Furthermore, this work showed that the CSP spatial filter was helpful to identify EEG channels involved in seizure onsets. These satisfactory results indicate that the proposed system may provide a reference for seizure onset detection in clinical applications.",https://doi.org/10.1109/TNSRE.2021.3055276,10.1109/TNSRE.2021.3055276,,2021,28/03/2024 1:15,28/03/2024 1:15,,458-467,,,29,,IEEE Transactions on Neural Systems and Rehabilitation Engineering,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,<p>ASReview_relevant</p>,,,common spatial pattern; Databases; Discrete wavelet transforms; Electroencephalography; empirical mode decomposition; Epilepsy; Feature extraction; Scalp; scalp EEG; Seizure onset detection; Support vector machines,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Yes,,,,Include,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This paper presents a novel seizure detection method using sparse representation-based Earth Mover’s Distance (SR-EMD). In the proposed algorithm, wavelet decomposition is executed on the original EEG recordings with five scales, and the scales 3, 4 and 5 are selected to structure the distributions of EEG signals. Then, the Gaussian mixture models (GMMs) of EEG signals are estimated and the distances between GMMs are computed using SR-EMD as EEG features. After that, EEG features are sent to Bayesian linear discriminant analysis classifier for classification. To improve the detection accuracy, the post-processing procedure is employed finally. The long-term intracranial EEG dataset with 21 patients is used to evaluate the performance of the method, and the satisfactory sensitivity of 93.54 %, specificity of 97.57 % and false detection rate of 0.223/h are achieved. The results indicate that SR-EMD is more effective and efficient than the conventional Earth Mover’s Distance (EMD).

Due to the unpredictable nature of seizures, the imbalanced classification of seizure and nonseizure data continues to be challenging. In this work, we first propose a novel algorithm named the borderline nearest neighbor synthetic minority oversampling technique (BNNSMOTE) to address the imbalanced classification problem and improve seizure detection performance. The algorithm uses the nearest neighbor notion to generate nonseizure samples near the boundary, then determines the seizure samples that are difficult to learn at the boundary, and lastly selects seizure samples at random to be used in the synthesis of new samples. In view of the characteristic that electroencephalogram (EEG) signals are one-dimensional signals, we then develop a 1D-MobileNet model to validate the algorithm's performance. Results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm outperforms previous seizure detection methods on the CHB-MIT dataset, achieving an average accuracy of 99.40%, a recall value of 87.46%, a precision of 97.17%, and an F1-score of 91.90%, respectively. We also had considerable success when we used additional datasets for verification at the same time. Our algorithm's data augmentation effects are more pronounced and perform better at seizure detection than the existing imbalanced techniques. Besides, the model's parameters and calculation volume have been significantly reduced, making it more suitable for mobile terminals and embedded devices.  © 2022 Peiling Zhang et al.",https://doi.org/10.1155/2022/4114178,10.1155/2022/4114178,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85145072388&doi=10.1155%2f2022%2f4114178&partnerID=40&md5=63cc74be4f5126387a25caab0fb6c72b,2022,28/03/2024 1:15,28/03/2024 1:15,,,,,2022,,J.

These problems have motivated the development of various automated seizure detection systems that can aid neurophysiologists in accurate diagnosis of epilepsy. The present study is focused on the development of a robust automated system for classification against low levels of supervised training. EEG data from two different repositories are considered for analysis and validation of the proposed system. The signals are decomposed into time-frequency sub-bands till sixth level using dual-tree complex wavelet transform (DTCWT). All details and last approximation coefficients are used to calculate features viz. energy, standard deviation, root-mean-square, Shannon entropy, mean values and maximum peaks. These feature sets are passed through a general regression neural network (GRNN) for classification with K-fold cross-validation scheme under varying train-to-test ratios. The current model yields ceiling level classification performance (accuracy, sensitivity & specificity) in all combinations of datasets (ictal vs non-ictal) in less than 0.028 s.

However, accumulation of multivariate EEG signals is not sufficient to unleash the power of multi-view information. Therefore, in this paper we propose a novel multi-view learning framework with a unified multidomain feature learning method for seizure epilepsy detection. We first apply a patient-specific channel selection mechanism to pick up seizure-relevant EEG channels and construct a multiview framework by adopting discrete wavelet transform (DWT) method to generalize selected five-channel signals into five sets of sub-band frequency components corresponding to five views, which enhances intra-view coherence and cross-view complementary efficiently. Moreover, a unified feature learning method within each view is proposed with common spatial patterns (CSP) for statistical and morphological features and a semi-supervised maximum mean discrepancy autoencoder (semi-MMDAE) for cross-channel time-frequency domain representations extraction. Instead of extracting sub-feature sets separately, unified feature learning procedure prevents overfitting problem and reduces redundant features efficiently.

Detecting epileptic seizures manually is a long tedious process, creating the need for automatic detections systems. A neural network is designed based on a convolutional neural network (CNN) and trained on the electroencephalogram (EEG) raw signal dataset “CHB-MIT”. Deep learning has not been fully explored in seizure detection, but rather only classical machine learning algorithms that need feature extraction. There is a need to explore deep learning which eliminates manual feature extraction and enables real-time detection of raw signals.

Yu,Automatic Epilepsy Detection Based on Wavelets Constructed From Data,IEEE Access,,2169-3536,"Epileptic seizures are caused by excessive, synchronized activity of large groups of neurons. In human electroencephalograph (EEG), they are reflected by multiple epileptic characteristic waves. Based on the idea of template matching, this paper presents a patient-specific approach for the automatic detection of epileptic seizures. In our method, a set of wavelets are constructed based on the epileptic characteristic waves extracted from training EEG signals, and then continuous wavelet transform (CWT) is performed on the recorded EEG. The coefficients of CWT reflect the similarity of the recorded EEG and the epileptic characteristic waveforms and thus can be used to detect if the epileptic characteristic waveforms exist in the EEG. After applying data fusion to the CWT coefficient matrices corresponding to the multiple constructed wavelets, the boundaries of seizures can be determined. In the experiment, our constructed wavelets performed better in the detection of epileptic characteristic waves compared to the Daubechies wavelet. We analyzed the EEG of 10 patients and our method detected 32 out of 34 seizures and declared five false detections.

Nonautomatic epilepsy detection is onerous and may be prone to error. They have augmented automated detection of seizure methods to attain accurate results. In view of this research work, we designed a frequency localized optimal filter bank to assess their effectiveness for automatic detection of seizures from EEG records. The basic preferred requirement of optimal filters relies on low bandwidth in the discipline of biomedical signal processing. This work provides a novel filter bank method called optimal equilateral wavelet filter bank (OEWFB) to satisfy the regularity criteria. This regularity constraint is being satisfied with semi-definite programming (SDP) framework, which specifically does nothing with any parameterization. Implementing the proposed filter banks, it disbands EEG signals into five wavelet sub-bands. The fuzzy entropy (FuEn), Renyi's entropy (ReEn), and the Kraskov entropy (KrEn) are being used for extracting the features from the wavelet sub-bands. The P values provide the distinctive ability of the features. Classification with 10-fold cross-validation for several classifiers such as quadratic discriminant, linear quadratic discriminant, K-nearest neighbor, support vector machine, logistic regression, and complex tree is utilized to classify the EEG signals into seizure vs non-seizure class and seizure-free vs seizure affected class. The proposed research work has gained the highest accuracy, specificity, sensitivity, and positive predictive values of 99.4%, 99%, 99.66%, and 99.35%, respectively, for class-1 (ABCD vs E).

While its effects are different for each person, they mostly include abnormal behaviour, periods of loss of awareness and seizures. There are various traditional methods used to analyse EEG signals for epilepsy detection, which concludes to be time-consuming. Recently, several automated seizure detection frameworks using machine learning algorithms have been proposed to replace conventional methods.

Firstly, Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) is applied to EEG signals for extracting the time-frequency domain features of epileptic seizures such as the energy of each sub-pattern, spike rhythmicity, Relative Spike Amplitude (RSA), Dominant Frequency (DF) and Spectral Entropy (SE). The features obtained after performing DWT on an EEG signal are extensive in number, to select the prominent features and to retain their properties, correlation feature sub-pattern-based PCA (SPPCA), and cross sub-pattern correlation-based PCA (SUBXPCA) are used as a dimensionality reduction techniques. To validate the proposed work, performance evaluation parameter such as the accuracy of the time-frequency domain features from different combinations of the dataset has been compared with the latest state-of-the-art works.

Method This paper proposes a new method based on weighted visibility graph entropy (WVGE) to identify seizure from EEG signals. Single channel EEG signals are mapped onto the WVGs and WVGEs are calculated from these WVGs. Then some features are extracted of WVGEs and given to classifiers to investigate the performance of these features to classify the brain signals into three groups of normal (healthy), seizure free (interictal) and during a seizure (ictal) groups. Four popular classifiers namely Support Vector Machine (SVM), K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN), Decision tree (DT) and, Naïve Bayes (NB) are used in this work. Result Experimental results show that the proposed method can classify normal, ictal and interictal groups with a high accuracy of 97%.

The brain signals are recorded with the help of electrocorticography (ECoG), Electroencephalogram (EEG). From the brain signal, the abnormal brain functions are a more challenging task. The traditional systems are consuming more time to predict unusual brain patterns. Therefore, in this paper, effective bio-inspired machine learning techniques are utilized to predict the epilepsy seizure from the EEG signal with maximum recognition accuracy. Initially, patient brain images are collected by placing the electrodes on their scalp. From the brain signal, different features are extracted that are analyzed with the help of the Krill Herd algorithm for selecting the best features. The selected features are processed using an artificial alga optimized general Adversarial Networks. The network recognizes the intricate and abnormal seizure patterns.

Electroencephalograms (EEGs), which capture brain neural activity, can detect epilepsy. Traditional methods for analyzing an EEG signal for epileptic seizure detection are time-consuming. Recently, several automated seizure detection frameworks using machine learning technique have been proposed to replace these traditional methods. The two basic steps involved in machine learning are feature extraction and classification. Feature extraction reduces the input pattern space by keeping informative features and the classifier assigns the appropriate class label. In this paper, we propose two effective approaches involving subpattern based PCA (SpPCA) and cross-subpattern correlation-based PCA (SubXPCA) with Support Vector Machine (SVM) for automated seizure detection in EEG signals. Feature extraction was performed using SpPCA and SubXPCA. Both techniques explore the subpattern correlation of EEG signals, which helps in decision-making process. SVM is used for classification of seizure and non-seizure EEG signals. The SVM was trained with radial basis kernel. All the experiments have been carried out on the benchmark epilepsy EEG dataset. The entire dataset consists of 500 EEG signals recorded under different scenarios. Seven different experimental cases for classification have been conducted. The classification accuracy was evaluated using tenfold cross validation. The classification results of the proposed approaches have been compared with the results of some of existing techniques proposed in the literature to establish the claim. © 2017, Australasian College of Physical Scientists and Engineers in Medicine.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s13246-017-0610-y,10.1007/s13246-017-0610-y,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85038637084&doi=10.1007%2fs13246-017-0610-y&partnerID=40&md5=484a5f7295d6d47071c8abfc4f87e3eb,2018,28/03/2024 1:15,28/03/2024 1:15,,81-94,,1,41,,Australas.

In the classification and detection of epileptic seizures, electroencephalography (EEG) measurements, which record the electrical activities of the brain, are frequently used. Empirical mode decomposition (EMD) and its derivative, ensemble EMD (EEMD) are recently developed methods used to decompose non-stationary and nonlinear signals such as EEG into a finite number of oscillations called intrinsic mode functions (IMFs). Our main objective in this study is to present a hybrid IMF selection method combining four different approaches (energy, correlation, power spectral distance, and statistical significance measures), and investigate the effect of selected IMFs extracted by EMD and EEMD on the classification. We have applied the proposed IMF selection approach on the classification of EEG signals recorded from epilepsy patients who are under treatment at our collaborator hospital. Multichannel EEG signals collected from epilepsy patients are decomposed into IMFs, and then IMF selection was performed. Finally, time- and spectral-domain, and nonlinear features are extracted and feature sets are created for the classification. Results: The maximum classification accuracies obtained using various combinations of IMFs were 94.56%, 95.63%, 96.8%, and 96.25% for SVM, KNN, naive Bayes, and logistic regression classifiers, respectively, by using EMD analysis; whereas, the EEMD approach has provided maximum classification accuracies of 96.06%, 97%, 97%, and 96.25% for SVM, KNN, naive Bayes, and logistic regression, respectively. Classification performance with the same features obtained using direct EEG signals instead of the decomposed IMFs was worse than the aforementioned 2 approaches for every combination. Conclusion: Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed IMF selection approach affects the classification results. Also, EEMD provides a robust method for feature extraction from EEG signals in order to classify pre-seizure and seizure segments. © 2020 The Author(s).",https://doi.org/10.1186/s12938-020-0754-y,10.1186/s12938-020-0754-y,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85079359528&doi=10.1186%2fs12938-020-0754-y&partnerID=40&md5=6e3621c8261a20fa962de0430734664c,2020,28/03/2024 1:15,28/03/2024 1:15,,,,1,19,,Biomed.

Monitoring brain activity via electroencephalogram (EEG) is an established method for epilepsy diagnosis and for monitoring epilepsy patients. Yet, it is not favorable to visually inspect EEG signals to diagnose epilepsy, especially in the case of long-term recordings. This process is time consuming and tedious error-prone exercise. In recent years, the sub-field of machine learning called deep learning has achieved remarkable success in various artificial intelligence research areas. In this paper, we present a method based on the deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to perform unsupervised feature learning framework for automated seizure onset detection. The proposed system was evaluated on 526 hours duration of scalp EEG data, including 181 seizures of 23 pediatric patients. The different parameters of CNNs were optimized through 4-fold nested cross-validation.

However, current detection approaches mainly rely on limited features manually designed by domain experts, which are inflexible for the detection of a variety of patterns in a large amount of patients' EEG data. Moreover, conventional machine learning algorithms for seizure detection cannot accommodate multi-channel Electroencephalogram (EEG) data effectively, which contains both temporal and spatial information. Recently, deep learning technology has been widely applied to perform image processing tasks, which could learns useful features from data and process multi-channel data automatically. To provide an effective system for automatic seizure detection, we proposed a new three-dimensional (3D) convolutional neural network (CNN) structure, whose inputs are multi-channel EEG signals. Methods: EEG data of 13 patients were collected from one center hospital, which has already been inspected by experts. To represent EEG data in CNN, firstly time series of each channel of EEG data was converted into the two-dimensional image. Then all channel images were combined into 3D images according to the mutual correlation intensity between different electrodes. Finally, a CNN was constructed using 3D kernels to predict different stages of EEG data, including inter-ictal, pre-ictal, and ictal stages. The system performance was evaluated and compared with the traditional feature-based classifier and the two-dimensional (2D) deep learning method. Results: It demonstrated that multi-channel EEG data could provide more information for increasing the specificity and sensitivity in cpmparison result between the single and multi-channel. And the 3D CNN based on multi-channel outperformed the 2D CNN and traditional signal processing methods with an accuracy of more than 90%, an sensitivity of 88.90% and an specificity of 93.78%. Conclusions: This is the first effort to apply 3D CNN in detecting seizures from EEG. It provides a new way of learning patterns simultaneously from multi-channel EEG signals, and demonstrates that deep neural networks in combination with 3D kernels can establish an effective system for seizure detection. © 2018 The Author(s).",https://doi.org/10.1186/s12911-018-0693-8,10.1186/s12911-018-0693-8,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85058059017&doi=10.1186%2fs12911-018-0693-8&partnerID=40&md5=f46db777cf8d73ebb91da3d365f8ae10,2018,28/03/2024 1:15,28/03/2024 1:15,,,,,18,,BMC Med.

Proc.,0094243X (ISSN); 978-073541241-5 (ISBN),,"Feature selection is a very important aspect in the field of machine learning. It entails the search of an optimal subset from a very large data set with high dimensional feature space. Apart from eliminating redundant features and reducing computational cost, a good selection of feature also leads to higher prediction and classification accuracy. In this paper, an efficient feature selection technique is introduced in the task of epileptic seizure detection. The raw data are electroencephalography (EEG) signals. Using discrete wavelet transform, the biomedical signals were decomposed into several sets of wavelet coefficients. To reduce the dimension of these wavelet coefficients, a feature selection method that combines the strength of both filter and wrapper methods is proposed. Principal component analysis (PCA) is used as part of the filter method. As for wrapper method, the evolutionary harmony search (HS) algorithm is employed. This metaheuristic method aims at finding the best discriminating set of features from the original data. The obtained features were then used as input for an automated classifier, namely wavelet neural networks (WNNs). The WNNs model was trained to perform a binary classification task, that is, to determine whether a given EEG signal was normal or epileptic. For comparison purposes, different sets of features were also used as input. Simulation results showed that the WNNs that used the features chosen by the hybrid algorithm achieved the highest overall classification accuracy. © 2014 AIP Publishing LLC.",https://doi.org/10.1063/1.4887590,10.1063/1.4887590,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84904624119&doi=10.1063%2f1.4887590&partnerID=40&md5=bf01c4bdf2bd0ade56a2cfaa5ceec241,2014,28/03/2024 1:15,28/03/2024 1:15,,209-214,,,1605,,,,,,,,American Institute of Physics Inc.,,English,,,Scopus,,,,,"<p>ASReview_relevant</p>; <p>Export Date: 13 February 2024; Cited By: 0; Conference name: 21st National Symposium on Mathematical Sciences: Germination of Mathematical Sciences Education and Research Towards Global Sustainability, SKSM 21; Conference date: 6 November 2013 through 8 November 2013; Conference code: 106463</p>",,,Algorithms; Artificial intelligence; Bioelectric phenomena; Classification accuracy; Cultivation; Discrete wavelet transforms; Efficient feature selections; Electrophysiology; Epileptic seizure detection; Feature extraction; Feature selection; Feature selection methods; harmony search; Harmony search; High-dimensional feature space; Neurodegenerative diseases; Neurophysiology; principal component analysis; Principal component analysis; seizure detection; Seizure detection; Signal detection; Sustainable development; wavelet neural networks; Wavelet neural networks,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,AIP Conference Proceedings,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Yes,,,,Include,,,Machine Learning,,,,,,,1.

The TQWT decomposes the EEG signals into subbands and arrange them into decreasing order of frequency. The nonlinearity of the EEG signals is assessed by computing the centered correntropy (CCE) from the obtained subbands, which is further used as a feature for classifying the different categories of EEG signals. In this work, EEG signals are categorised in two different classification problems. First category is seizure free and seizure (NF-S) classes, and the other one is the normal, seizure free and seizure (ZO-NF-S) classes. Features obtained from the EEG signals of these classes are fed to the input of three different classifiers namely, random forest classifier (RF), multilayer perceptron (MLP) classifier, and logistic regression (LR) classifier. For NF-S classes, we achieved 98.3% classification accuracy with RF classifier for signal length of 1000 samples. The obtained accuracy of classification is 98.2% for ZO-NF-S classes using MLP classifier when features are extracted from signal length of 1000 samples. (C) 2017 Karabuk University.

The main aim of this method is to improve the seizure classification accuracy of the epileptic EEG signals. In the proposed RLS based approach, initially the EEG signal is pre-processed using RLS dependent adaptive filter followed by the segment-wise computation of the relative band power in terms of frequency present in the epileptic seizure information. At last, support vector machine (SVM) is used to classify the EEG signal into seizure and non-seizure data. The experimental investigation shows that the RLS approach has attained a classification accuracy of 94.876%, 97.594% sensitivity, and 91.856% specificity.

To this effect, a benchmark for choosing delays is defined based on the autocorrelation function. For each lag, traditional indicators, including the number of points lying on the identity line, the length of the minor (SD1)/major axis (SD2) of the fitted ellipse on the plot, the SD1/SD2 ratio, and the area of the ellipse, were calculated. The efficiency of the features in discriminating between the groups was examined based on the statistical significance of the differences. K-nearest neighbor and probabilistic neural network were employed as the classifier. The performance of the suggested scheme was evaluated using a publicly available database that includes numerous EEG data of healthy, during the incidence of an epileptic seizure and seizure-free intervals cases.

It is symbolized by recurring seizure activities in particular regions of the brain. Electroencephalogram (EEG) signals contain information about the brain activity that can be used to identify areas affected by seizures. For this, however, neurologists have the challenging task to analyze the EEG signal to imply where the source of epilepsy is located. A novel approach to detect regions of focal epilepsy is proposed in this paper. By using an adaptive mixture of independent component analysis as a decomposition algorithm and information about the position of the measuring electrodes, EEG signals are transformed into two-dimensional brain maps that are further altered by a symmetric-weighted scale-invariant local ternary pattern technique. Features from this altered brain map are used as input in a three-layered artificial neural network for classification between epileptic and artifact brain maps. The brain maps classified as artifact are eliminated, and the epileptic components are given as output for doctors to investigate the regions of the brain affected by focal epilepsy.

However, the large numbers of time series make it quite challenging to establish a high performance automatic detection method.

First, the CC algorithm is used to identify similar discontinuous local temporal patterns. Then, the bicluster membership matrix using a new similarity measurement is constructed to reduce the dimensionality. At last, the ELM classifier is adopted to discriminate between epileptic seizure and seizure-free EEG signals.

The goal of this paper is to present a new method for classification of epileptic phases based on the sub-bands of electroencephalogram (EEG) signals obtained from the Stockwell transform (ST). ST is a time-frequency analysis that not only covers the advantages of both short-time Fourier transform (FT) and wavelet transform (WT), but also overcomes their shortcomings. In the proposed method, at first, EEG signal is transformed into time-frequency domain using ST and all operations are performed in the new domain. Then, the amplitudes of ST in five sub-bands, namely delta (δ), theta (θ), alpha (α), beta (β), and gamma (γ), are computed. In order to classify EEG signal as healthy, interictal, and ictal, we obtain the distributions of amplitudes of ST in different sub-bands. In this way, for each EEG signal, five feature vectors, each for one sub-band are obtained. Next, kernel principal component analysis (KPCA) is used to extract the informative features from the feature vectors. Finally, the distances between the informative features of test and training samples in different sub-bands are calculated and the weighted linear combination of them is applied to the nearest neighbor classifier. We consider different distance measures. The test sample is assigned to the class of the training sample which has minimum distance from it. The results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves higher efficiency in comparison with the recently proposed algorithms. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bspc.2017.05.008,10.1016/j.bspc.2017.05.008,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85019981326&doi=10.1016%2fj.bspc.2017.05.008&partnerID=40&md5=245229abb9ded95cd4a15ff6a2c59815,2017,28/03/2024 1:15,28/03/2024 1:15,,108-118,,,38,,Biomed.

Epileptic Seizures are the results of the fleeting and surprising electric phenomenon of the brain. Electroencephalogram (EEG) signal is a vital information supply in diagnosing epilepsy because it records electrical and neural activities from the brain. Traditionally, these graphical record signals (EEG) are manually observed by medical practitioners which is time taking and gives improper result. In this paper, we have a tendency to propose a brand-new computer based mostly automatic epilepsy seizure detection concept. The EEG signal from epileptic and healthy patients were divided and broken into frequency sub-band with the help of Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT). We applied feature extraction in these frequency sub-bands and extracted 10 features out of them. The features extracted were then fed into four different classifiers particularly, Support Vector Machine (SVM) k-nearest neighbor (kNN), Naïve-Bayes and Decision Tree classifiers.

In this paper, we introduce the offline seizure detection algorithms using single-channel and one-second-length of short-time EEG signals based on time domain and novel frequency-sequency features and also novel feature reduction scenarios. After preprocessing stages, the EEG signals are decomposed to five brain rhythms using uniform discrete Fourier transform (DFT)-based filter bank. Then, transform-based features by the DFT and discrete Walsh–Hadamard transform are defined. With computing spectral correlation model (SCM) using Fourier and Walsh patterns of the rhythms, the Walsh power is computed as a modulus maximum feature that is called spectral correlation power. By segmenting the SCM, the histogram-based statistical features namely; kurtosis, skewness and negentropy as non-Gaussianity measures of probability density function for each epoch of the SCM are calculated. These extracted features are fused in multi-level structures with four different arrangements of kernel-principle component analysis, linear discriminant analysis and kernel matrix. These feature reduction methods are called multi-level dimensionality reduction (MLDR) algorithms. Ultimately, the reduced features with a hybrid model of particle swarm optimization and probabilistic neural network are applied to select the optimal features. To classify the EEG signals into the seizure and non-seizure classes, an optimized non-linear support vector machine classifier with the Gaussian radial basis function kernel is employed.

Epilepsy affects around 50 million individuals worldwide, making it one of the most prevalent neurological illnesses. Epilepsy may happen without any specific reason due to genetic deficiency. The unpredictable nature of epilepsy is very dangerous one. Deep learning is a subclass of machine learning that use many layers of processing to extract higher-level features from input. It has been utilized in a number of applications such as computer vision, natural language processing, and so on. Deep Learning is gaining much popularity due to its supremacy in terms of accuracy when trained with huge amount of data. It learns from examples to automatically discriminate different classes. Even though it merits greater attention from the Deep Learning community in epileptic seizure prediction is a field of study. In this study, we provide an LSTM model for detecting and predicting seizure presents states that take into account the chaotic nature of an EEG dataset. Our model is validated by feeding LSTM with an Epilepsy seizure recognition Data Set, which is available in the UCI Database, which is open to the public in the form of comma separated value released by Kaggle. Purpose: Epilepsy affects about 1% of the world's population. The development of fresh methodologies in the field of epilepsy prediction is in great demand. The requirement for a low-cost wearable monitoring gadget to forecast epilepsy state may establish a fear-free atmosphere for those affected. Observations: Most of the papers were written based on seizure detection by using machine learning techniques and mobile alert to caretakers using smart device. There have been some intriguing new advancements in Internet of Things and Deep learning based strategies that have the potential to create a paradigm change in epileptic seizure prediction [26].

Electroencephalogram (EEG) is one of the commonly used devices for seizure recognition and epilepsy detection. Recognition of convulsions using EEG waves takes a relatively long time because it is conducted physically by epileptologists. The EEG signals are analyzed and categorized, after being captured, into two types, which are normal or abnormal (indicating an epileptic seizure). This study relies on EEG signals which are provided by Arrhythmia Database. Thus, this work is a step beyond the traditional database mission of delivering users’ inquiries; instead, this work is to extract insight and knowledge of such data. The features are extracted from the signals by applying the Discrete Wavelet transform (DWT) method on the input EEG signals. Two different algorithms Support vector machine (SVM) and k-nearest neighbours (KNN) are applied to the extracted features. After using the above method, two different types of EEG are expected by using classification, either to be normal (refers to the normal activeness of the brain) or abnormal (refers to the non-normal activeness of the brain, which may involve epilepsy). The evaluation is based on three parameters (Precision, Recall, and Accuracy), and also on the implementation time. In this research, two different methods are used, the first is the DWT with SVM, and the second is the DWT with KNN. With regard to the three-parameter values and implementation time, it turned out that the second method was more efficient than the first because of its higher accuracy. © 2021 University of Baghdad-College of Science.

In this study, an intelligent detection framework with the discriminative Stein kernel-based sparse representation (DSK-SR) is constructed to distinguish epileptic EEG signals. Specifically, in the scheme of DSK-SR, EEG samples are presented by symmetric positive definite (SPD) matrices in the form of covariance descriptors (CovDs). Taking into account the non-Euclidean geometry of the Riemannian manifold of SPD matrices, the traditional SR in Euclidean space cannot be applied in its original form on the manifold. To this end, the DSK defined on the manifold can permit us to embed the manifold into a high-dimensional reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) to perform SR. Then, test samples are sparsely coded over the training sets, and the classification decision is performed by assessing which class generates the minimal reconstructed residuals. Eventually, competitive experimental results on three widely recognized EEG datasets against the state-of-the-art methods demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed DSK-SR in identifying epileptic EEG signals, indicating its powerful application potential in the automatic seizure detection.",https://doi.org/10.1109/TIM.2021.3137159,10.1109/TIM.2021.3137159,,2022,28/03/2024 1:15,28/03/2024 1:15,,Jan-15,,,71,,IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,<p>ASReview_relevant</p>,,,Electroencephalography; Covariance matrices; seizure detection; Discriminative Stein kernel (DSK); Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions; Kernel; Sparse matrices; Task analysis; electroencephalogram (EEG); Manifolds; sparse representation (SR); symmetric positive definite (SPD) matrix,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Yes,,,,Include,,3 databases,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Rajaguru,"Factor analysis, Hessian Local Linear Embedding and Isomap for epilepsy classification from EEG",2016 Electrical Engineering Conference (EECon),,,"In this present generation, more than 1% of the whole world's population is affected by this seizure disorder. Due to genetic predispositions like tumours, strokes and drug misuse, epilepsy is caused. Epilepsy is a common brain disorder in which cluster of neuronal signals function abnormally. For preventing seizures, medications are available but only some patients can respond well to the medication. Other remedial measures such as neurostimulation, surgery, maintaining a healthy diet are not always successful in treating the patient. Because of epilepsy, the patients have to live with persistent anxiety throughout their lives and also leading a normal life and performing day to day and social tasks becomes more difficult for them. For the analysis and diagnosis of epilepsy, the detection and classification of seizures forms the most important step. The vital information regarding the dynamics of the brain can be easily measured by Electroencephalogram (EEG). Since the recordings of the EEG data are pretty long, the obtained data is too huge to process and so, in this study, the dimension of the EEG data is reduced by Dimensionality Reduction (DR) techniques such as Factor Analysis (FA), Hessian Local Linear Embedding (HLLE) and Isomap (IM). The dimensionally reduced values are then classified with the help of Genetic Algorithm (GA) and Generalized Regression Neural Network (GRNN). The performance metrics are analyzed with parameters such as performance index, sensitivity, specificity, time delay, quality value and accuracy. The results show that when FA, HLLE and Isomap are classified with GRNN, then a perfect classification of 100% and an accuracy of 100% are obtained. If the dimensionality reduction techniques classified with GA are compared, then a high accuracy of 95.24% is obtained when it is classified with HLLE-GA combination.",https://doi.org/10.1109/EECon.2016.7830929,10.1109/EECon.2016.7830929,,15/12/2016,28/03/2024 1:15,28/03/2024 1:15,,19-24,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,<p>ASReview_relevant</p>,,,EEG; Electroencephalography; Epilepsy; Entropy; Sociology; Matrix decomposition; Genetic algorithms; Manifolds; GA; FA; HLLE; Isomap,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2016 Electrical Engineering Conference (EECon),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Yes,,,,Include,,Sri Ramakrishna Hospital,,,,,,,100.00%,,,,,,,,,

In this algorithm, spectral features in five frequency bands (Δ, α, ß, θ and γ) is extracted from small frames of seizure and non-seizure EEG signals by applying Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) and Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT). These features can create the maximum distinction between two classes.

This classifier allows adjusting the parameter of the NN classifier, efficiently. Finally, the performance of algorithm is evaluated based on three measures, sensitivity, specificity and latency.

But people with epilepsy cannot lead a social life like others. Proper diagnosis and advance prediction of epileptic seizures definitely improves the life of epilepsy patients. In this paper an effort is made to develop a seizure detection and prediction method using stacked bidirectional long short term memory technique. This is the most suitable technique for the analysis of time series datasets as it overcomes the vanishing gradient problem identified in recurrent neural network. The dataset for detection and prediction experiments was taken from Bonn University. Our model could perform the seizure detection with the highest accuracy of 99.08% with 98% precision, 99.5% recall and ROC AUC: 0.984346. A binary classification method with AUC more than 0.9 is considered to be outstanding. Seizure prediction was conducted using the same dataset by classifying preictal states of EEG from interictal and ictal states. For the case of prediction our model could identify preictal states with the overall sensitivity: 89.21% and false prediction rate: 0.06. In future the model could be used to program the wearable devices like wrist watch which can be used by epileptic patients for seizure prediction. The device could be programmed to fire alarm during the detection of the preictal EEG signal before the onset of the seizure. © 2019",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.patrec.2019.10.034,10.1016/j.patrec.2019.10.034,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85074609398&doi=10.1016%2fj.patrec.2019.10.034&partnerID=40&md5=dcb48a283923de88da464e5d33587dd1,2019,28/03/2024 1:15,28/03/2024 1:15,,529-535,,,128,,Pattern Recogn.

However, it is still a challenging problem. This paper presents a novel framework for this task where joint time-domain features are firstly computed to extract temporal fluctuations of a given EEG data stream; and then, an auto-regressive (AR) linear model is adopted to model the data and temporal anomalies are subsequently calculated from that model to reflect the possibilities that a change occurs; a non-parametric statistical test based on Randomized Power Martingale (RPM) is last performed for making change decision from the resulting anomaly scores. We conducted experiments on the publicly-available Bern-Barcelona EEG database where promising results for terms of detection precision (96.97%), detection recall (97.66%) as well as computational efficiency have been achieved. Meanwhile, we also evaluated the proposed method for real detection of seizures occurrence for a monitoring epilepsy patient. The results of experiments by using both the testing database and real application demonstrated the effectiveness and feasibility of the method for the purpose of change detection in EEG signals.

Finally, we classify 4 EEG classes; which are Normal, Interictal, Focal and Non-focal. This classification was conducted by the Fuzzy classifier which is consisting of Fuzzifier, Inference Queue, Defuzzification Unit, and a knowledge Based unit.

If an algorithm could automatically detect seizures and deliver the patient therapy or notify the hospital, that would be of great assistance. Analyzing the scalp electroencephalogram (EEG) is the most common way to detect the onset of a seizure. In this paper, we proposed the context-learning based EEG analysis for seizure detection (Context-EEG) algorithm. Methods: The proposed method aims at extracting both the hidden inherent features within EEG fragments and the temporal features from EEG contexts. First, we segment the EEG signals into EEG fragments of fixed length. Second, we learn the hidden inherent features from each fragment with a sparse auto-encoder and thus the dimensionality of the original data is reduced. Third, we translate each EEG fragment to an EEG word so that a continuous EEG signal is converted to a sequence of EEG words. Fourth, by analyzing the context information of EEG words, we learn the temporal features for EEG signals. And finally, we concatenate the hidden features and the temporal features together to train a binary classifier which can be used to detect the onset of an epileptic sezure. Results: 4302 EEG fragments from four different patients are used to train and test our model. An error rate of 22.93 % is achieved by our model as a general, non-patient specific seizure detector. The error rate of our model is averagely 16.7 % lower than the other baseline models. Receiver operating characteristics (ROC curve) and area under curve (AUC) confirm the effectiveness of our model. Furthermore, we discuss the extracted features and how to reconstruct the original data based on the extracted features, as well as the parameter sensitivity. Conclusions: Given a EEG fragment, by extracting high-quality features (the hidden inherent features and temporal features) from the EEG signals, our Context-EEG model is able to detect the onset of a seizure with high accuracy in real time. © 2016 The Author(s).",https://doi.org/10.1186/s12911-016-0310-7,10.1186/s12911-016-0310-7,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84978863802&doi=10.1186%2fs12911-016-0310-7&partnerID=40&md5=6e46d16cf2032c4823e7208ee7bc2519,2016,28/03/2024 1:15,28/03/2024 1:15,,,,,16,,BMC Med.

Methods Compared with the long non-seizure periods, the durations of the seizure events are much shorter in the continuous EEG recordings. So the seizure detection task can be regarded as an imbalanced classification problem. In this paper, a novel method based on the weighted extreme learning machine (ELM) is proposed for seizure detection with imbalanced EEG data distribution. Firstly, the wavelet packet transform is employed to analyze the EEG data and obtain the time and frequency domain features, and the pattern match regularity statistic (PMRS) is used as the nonlinear feature to quantify the complexity of the EEG time series. After that, the EEG feature vectors are discriminated by the weighted ELM. It can assign different weights for the EEG feature samples according to the class distribution, so that to effectively moderate the bias in performance caused by imbalanced class distribution. Results The metric G-mean which takes into account of both the sensitivity and specificity is used to evaluate the performance of this method. The G-mean of 93.96%, event-based sensitivity of 97.73% and false alarm rate of 0.37/h are yielded on the publicly available EEG dataset. Conclusion The comparison with other detection methods shows the superior performance of this method, which indicates its potential for detecting seizure events in clinical practice. Additionally, much larger amounts of true continuous EEG data will be used to test the proposed method further in the future work. © 2017 British Epilepsy Association",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.seizure.2017.05.018,10.1016/j.seizure.2017.05.018,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85021175998&doi=10.1016%2fj.seizure.2017.05.018&partnerID=40&md5=6d772f0d8ddfb31fb21acbb9781e5690,2017,28/03/2024 1:15,28/03/2024 1:15,,99-108,,,50,,Seizure,,,,,,,,English,,,Scopus,,,,,"<p>ASReview_relevant</p>; <p>Export Date: 13 February 2024; Cited By: 95; Correspondence Address: Q.

The literature available on seizure detection has discussed the implementation of advanced signal processing algorithms using tools accessed over the cloud. However, seizure monitoring application needs near sensor processing due to privacy and latency issues. In this paper, a real time seizure detection system has been implemented using an embedded system. The proposed system is based on ensemble empirical mode decomposition (EEMD) and tunable-Q wavelet transform (TQWT) algorithms. The analysis and classification of non-stationary EEG signals require the wavelet transform with high Q-factor. However, direct use of TQWT increases the computational complexity of feature extraction from multivariate EEG signals. In this paper, the first step is to process the signal by using EEMD to obtain 8 intrinsic mode functions (IMFs). The Kraskov (KraEn), sample (SampEn), and permutation (PermEn) entropy features of IMFs are extracted and based on optimum values, and 4 IMFs are decomposed using TQWT. Secondly, centered correntropy (CenCorrEn) features of the 1st and 16th sub-band of TQWT have been used as classifier inputs. The performance of multilayer perceptron neural networks (MLPNN), least squares support vector machine (LSSVM), and random forest (RF) classifiers has been tested on the multichannel EEG data recorded from a local hospital. The RF classifier has produced the highest accuracy of 96.2% in classifying the signals.

As epilepsy causes some seizures in the brain, seizure detection can play an essential role in treating patients. In this paper, we concentrated on different graph-based methods intending to classify seizure and non-seizure states of the brain based on recorded EEG signals. We worked on Temple University Hospital (TUH) dataset which includes both focal and generalized seizures. Our goal was to reach a comprehensive comparison between these methods. Three methods were discussed: graph features, graph kernels, and graph multi-kernels. We considered each EEG channel as a node in the graph model. Also, graph edges were built through functional connectivity between every two nodes' signals. Therefore, we constructed one graph for each second of every patients' recorded EEG. Then, by using constructed graphs, we extracted some features from them, or calculated kernel matrix for each couple of them which reflects the similarity between graphs. In the multi-kernel method, these two approaches gathered together. After comparing the outcomes, we found kernel and multi-kernel methods more effective on this dataset.

The quality factor (Q) based multi-scale entropy measure is proposed to compute the entropy of the EEG signal in different frequency-bands of interest. The Q -based entropy (QEn) is computed by decomposing the signal with the tunable-Q wavelet transform (TQWT) into the number of sub-bands and estimating K-nearest neighbor (K-NN) entropies from various sub-bands cumulatively. The optimal selection of Q and the redundancy parameter (R) of TQWT showed better robustness for entropy computation in the presence of high- and low-frequency components. The extracted features are fed to the support vector machine (SVM) classifier with the wrapper-based feature selection method. The proposed method has achieved accuracy of 100% in classifying normal (eyes-open and eyes-closed) and seizure EEG signals, 99.5% in classifying seizure-free EEG signals (from the hippocampal formation of the opposite hemisphere of the brain) from seizure EEG signals and 98% in classifying seizure-free EEG signals (from the epileptogenic zone) from seizure EEG signals, respectively, using the SVM classifier. We have also achieved classification accuracies of 99% and 98.6% in classifying seizure versus non-seizure EEG signals and the individual three classes, namely normal, seizure-free and seizure EEG signals, respectively.

The non-linear analysis method is effectively applied to electroencephalogram signals to study the dynamics of the complex underlying behavior. Analyzing EEG signals with the aid of nonlinear dynamics takes the advantage of requiring much lower quantity of data. The objective of our research is to analyze the acquired EEG signals for non linearity by applying signal processing tools and use the non linear features for design of CAD system to classify epileptic seizures. To ensure the soundness of the proposed method and the suitability of the selected parameters, exhaustive statistical analysis of the descriptor components was performed.

Therefore, automatic seizure detection can help to reduce the time required to annotate EEGs. Automatic detection of seizures in clinical EEGs has been limited-to date. In this study, we present an XGBoost-based method to detect seizures in EEGs from the TUH-EEG Corpus. 4,597 EEG files were used to train the method, 1,013 EEGs were used as a validation set, and 1,026 EEG files were used to test the method. Sixty-four features were selected as the input to the training set, and Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique was used to balance the dataset.

A modified method for classification of ictal (Epileptic seizure) and seizure-free EEG signals is proposed in this paper. The technique is employed for an epoch across the channel for feature extraction. The First order derivative (FOD) shows the rate of variability of the signal while the phase space reconstruction (PSR) shows the evolution of a system and the Euclidean distance measures the dispersion of the points in the 3-D PSR, these shows a better feature for ictal and normal EEG signals classification. The interquartile range of Euclidean distance has been used for feature selection due to its insensitivity towards the outlier.

Epilepsy may have substantial impacts on the patient's quality of life, and its detection heavily relies on tedious and time-consuming manual curation by experienced clinicians, based on EEG signals. Most existing EEG-based seizure detection algorithms are patient-dependent and train a detection model for each patient. A new patient can only be monitored effectively after several episodes of epileptic seizures. This study investigates the patient-independent detection of seizure events using the open dataset CHB-MIT Scalp EEG. First, a novel feature extraction algorithm called MinMaxHist is proposed to measure the topological patterns of the EEG signals. Following this, MinMaxHist and several other feature extraction algorithms are applied to parameterize the EEG signals. Next, a comprehensive series of feature screening and classification optimization experiments are conducted, and finally, an optimized EEG-based seizure detection model is presented that can achieve overall values for accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, Matthews correlation coefficient, and Kappa of 0.8627, 0.8032, 0.9222, 0.7504 and 0.7254, respectively, with only 30 features.

An electroencephalogram (EEG) records neural activity, and it is commonly used for the diagnosis of epilepsy. To achieve accurate detection of epileptic seizures, an automatic detection approach of epileptic seizures, integrating complementary ensemble empirical mode decomposition (CEEMD) and extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), namedCEEMD-XGBoost, is proposed. Firstly, the decomposition method, CEEMD, which is capable of effectively reducing the influence of mode mixing and end effects, was utilized to divide raw EEG signals into a set of intrinsic mode functions (IMFs) and residues. Secondly, the multi-domain features were extracted from raw signals and the decomposed components, and they were further selected according to the importance scores of the extracted features. Finally, XGBoost was applied to develop the epileptic seizure detection model. Experiments were conducted on two benchmark epilepsy EEG datasets, named the Bonn dataset and the CHB-MIT (Children's Hospital Boston and Massachusetts Institute of Technology) dataset, to evaluate the performance of our proposed CEEMD-XGBoost.

However, the visual analysis of long-term EEG recordings is characterized by its subjectivity, time-consuming procedure and its erroneous detection. Various epileptic seizure detection algorithms have been proposed to deal with such issues. In this study, a novel automatic seizure-detection approach is proposed. Three different strategies are suggested to the user whereby he/she could choose the appropriate one for a given classification problem. Indeed, the feature extraction step, including both linear and nonlinear measures, is performed either directly from the EEG signals, or from the derived sub-bands of tunable-Q wavelet transform (TQWT), or even from the intrinsic mode functions (IMFs) of multivariate empirical mode decomposition (MEMD). The classification procedure is executed using a support vector machine (SVM). The performance of the proposed method is evaluated through a publicly available database from which six binary classification cases are formulated to discriminate between healthy, seizure and non-seizure EEG signals. Our results show high performance in terms of accuracy (ACC), sensitivity (SEN) and specificity (SPE) compared to the state-of-the-art approaches.

In terms of optimal design, seizure detection from EEG data has not been completely exploited by current models of deep learning. Most of the previous studies focus on handcrafted feature extraction for seizure detection. However, this method is not generalizable and needs major changes inside a new dataset for each new patient. In this paper, we proposed autonomously generalized retrospective and patient-specific hybrid models based on two types of feature extractors, namely Convolutional Neural Networks along with long short-term memory. The model automatically generates customized features to better classify ictal, interictal, and preictal segments for each patient and make it ideal for real-time. The procedure can be extended to any patient from Freiburg epileptic seizure database without the need for manual feature extraction. The method decomposed the EEG signals into time-based, frequency-based, and time–frequency-based features that were tested and compared in 21 subjects. Three forms of experiments including two binary classification problems and a ternary classification were performed to investigate the feasibility of the proposed approach. Using the time–frequency domain signals an average accuracy of 99.19%, 99.27%, and 95.04%, with frequency-domain signals, average accuracies of 96.64%, 95.75%, and 93.42% while with time-domain signals an average accuracy of 94.71%, 93.99%, and 90.53% was obtained.

For resolving these issues, this paper presents an automated seizure detection model using the Fuzzy Support Vector Machine (FSVM) model. HSVM is developed for multi-label classification where a region with related membership function is available for every class label and a data point is categorized to a multi-label class whose membership function is the higher. The performance of the FSVM model has been validated against the EEG signal dataset and the results are examined under several measures. The obtained results depicted that the FSVM model has achieved latter results with the maximum precision of 79.45%, recall of 79.63%, F-score of 78.50%, and accuracy of 79.65%.",https://doi.org/10.1109/ICECA49313.2020.9297607,10.1109/ICECA49313.2020.9297607,,5/11/2020,28/03/2024 1:15,28/03/2024 1:15,,58-62,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,<p>ASReview_relevant</p>,,,EEG; Electroencephalography; Training; Seizure detection; Epilepsy; Support vector machines; Brain modeling; Classification; Machine learning; Analytical models; Conferences; Support vector machine,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"2020 4th International Conference on Electronics, Communication and Aerospace Technology (ICECA)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Yes,,,,Include,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The epileptic detection in most previous research suffers from low power and unsuitability for processing large datasets. Therefore, a computerized epileptic seizure detection method is highly required to eradicate the aforementioned problems, expedite epilepsy research and aid medical professionals. In this work, we propose an automatic epilepsy diagnosis framework based on the combination of multi-domain feature extraction and nonlinear analysis of EEG signals. Firstly, EEG signals are pre-processed by using the wavelet threshold method to remove the artifacts. We then extract representative features in the time domain, frequency domain, time-frequency domain and nonlinear analysis features based on the information theory. These features are further extracted in five frequency sub-bands based on the clinical interest, and the dimension of the original feature space is then reduced by using both a principal component analysis and an analysis of variance. Furthermore, the optimal combination of the extracted features is identified and evaluated via different classifiers for the epileptic seizure detection of EEG signals. Finally, the performance of the proposed method is investigated by using a public EEG database at the University Hospital Bonn, Germany. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed epileptic seizure detection method can achieve a high average accuracy of 99.25%, indicating a powerful method in the detection and classification of epileptic seizures. The proposed seizure detection scheme is thus hoped to eliminate the burden of expert clinicians when they are processing a large number of data by visual observation and to speed-up the epilepsy diagnosis. © 2017 by the authors.",https://doi.org/10.3390/e19060222,10.3390/e19060222,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85020520893&doi=10.3390%2fe19060222&partnerID=40&md5=cbd7929a82928287d74a162a38c9199d,2017,28/03/2024 1:15,28/03/2024 1:15,,,,6,19,,Entropy,,,,,,,,English,,,Scopus,,,,,"<p>ASReview_relevant</p>; <p>Export Date: 13 February 2024; Cited By: 189; Correspondence Address: Y.

In this study, a simple distance based seizure onset detection algorithm is proposed to distinguish seizure and non-seizure EEG signals. The proposed framework first applies the common spatial patterns (CSP) method to enhance the signal-to-noise ratio and reduce the dimensionality of EEG signals, and then uses the autocorrelation of the averaged spatially filtered signal to classify incoming signals into a seizure or non-seizure state. The proposed approach was tested using CHB-MIT dataset that contains continuous scalp EEG recordings from 23 patients. The results showed ∼95.87% sensitivity with an average latency of 2.98 s and 2.89% false detection rate. More interestingly, the average process time required to classify each window (1–5 s of EEG signals) was 0.09 s.

Eapen,A Deep Convolutional Neural Network Method to Detect Seizures and Characteristic Frequencies Using Epileptic Electroencephalogram (EEG) Data,IEEE Journal of Translational Engineering in Health and Medicine,,2168-2372,"Background: Diagnosing epileptic seizures using electroencephalogram (EEG) in combination with deep learning computational methods has received much attention in recent years. However, to date, deep learning techniques in seizure detection have not been effectively harnessed due to sub-optimal classifier design and improper representation of the time-domain signal. Methods: In this study, we focused on designing and evaluating deep convolutional neural network-based classifiers for seizure detection. Signal-to-image conversion methods are proposed to convert time-domain EEG signal to a time-frequency represented image to prepare the input data for classification. We proposed and evaluated three classification methods comprising of five classifiers to determine which is more accurate for seizure detection. Accuracy data were then compared to previous studies of the same dataset. Results: We found our proposed model and signal-to-image conversion method outperformed all previous studies in the most cases. The proposed FT-VGG16 classifier achieved the highest average classification accuracy of 99.21%. In addition, the Shapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) analysis approach was employed to uncover the feature frequencies in the EEG that contribute most to improved classification accuracy. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to compute the contribution of frequency components to target seizure classification; thus allowing the identification of distinct seizure-related EEG frequency components compared to normal EEG measures. Conclusion: Thus our developed deep convolutional neural network models are useful to detect seizures and characteristic frequencies using EEG data collected from the patients and this model could be clinically applicable for the automated seizures detection.",https://doi.org/10.1109/JTEHM.2021.3050925,10.1109/JTEHM.2021.3050925,,2021,28/03/2024 1:15,28/03/2024 1:15,,1-Dec,,,9,,IEEE Journal of Translational Engineering in Health and Medicine,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,<p>ASReview_relevant</p>,,,Brain modeling; Continuous wavelet transforms; CWT; deep learning; Deep learning; EEG; Electroencephalography; Epilepsy; Feature extraction; seizure; Spectrogram; STFT; Time-frequency analysis,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Yes,,,,Include,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The proposed technique utilizes wavelet transform to compute the frequency characteristics of multi-channel EEG signals. The EEG signals are divided into 2 second epochs and frequency spectrum up to a cutoff frequency of 45 Hz is computed. This multi-channel raw spectral data forms the input to a one-dimensional CNN (1-D CNN). Spectral data from the current, previous, and next epochs is utilized for predicting the label of the current epoch.

However, seizure processes are typically dynamic and nonstationary, and thus, distinguishing rhythmic discharges from nonstationary processes is one of the challenging problems.

The dimensionality of extracted features can be greatly reduced by the principle component analysis algorithm before the most discriminative features selected are fed into a support vector machine (SVM) classifier with the radial basis function (RBF) in order to separate epileptic seizure from seizure-free EEG signals. The classification performance of the proposed method has been evaluated by using several state-of-art feature extraction algorithms and other five different classifiers like linear discriminant analysis, and logistic regression.

Prabhakar,Logistic regression Gaussian mixture model and softmax discriminant classifier for epilepsy classification from EEG signals,2017 International Conference on Computing Methodologies and Communication (ICCMC),,,"The patient suffers from spontaneous seizures under a neurological condition termed epilepsy. Due to the severe disturbances happening in the electrical activity of the brain, the seizures occur. An epileptic seizure is simply a transient occurrence of symptoms because of excessive and abnormal neuronal firing of neurons in the brain. Due to the hypersynchronous and abnormal activity of neurons in the brain, epilepsy manifests itself in the form of seizures. The most disabling aspect and the characteristic feature of this disease are witnessed by the occurrence of seizures. It is quite difficult to identify the presence of epileptic activities in order to characterize and understand the spatio-temporal patterns. The automatic classification and detection procedure of seizures from Electroencephalography (EEG) signals is quite crucial for the localization and epileptic seizure activity classification. The seizures are typically non stationary and highly dynamic in nature so that the rhythmic activities cannot be easily interpreted. In this paper, a two level classification procedure is employed, firstly the risk of epilepsy is classified with Softmax Discriminant Classifier (SDC) and secondly it is further optimized and classified with Logistic Regression Gaussian Mixture Model (LRGMM) Classifier. Results show that a classification accuracy of about 93.38% is obtained when classified with SDC and a classification accuracy of about 97.91% is obtained with classified with LRGMM.",https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCMC.2017.8282615,10.1109/ICCMC.2017.8282615,,18/07/2017,28/03/2024 1:15,28/03/2024 1:15,,985-988,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,<p>ASReview_relevant</p>,,,EEG; Electroencephalography; Epilepsy; Gaussian mixture model; Brain modeling; Sensitivity; Logistics; Conferences; LRGMM; SDC,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2017 International Conference on Computing Methodologies and Communication (ICCMC),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Yes,,,,Include,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

An automated seizure detector that requires a short period of normal EEG would shorten the seizure monitoring durations, decrease the need for manual assessment of large amount of recorded EEG data, and accordingly assist the neurologists focus on improving quality of care. In this work, we propose a novel approach based on the extended cumulative sum test to detect seizures using intracranial EEG. Different than the existing machine learning approaches, this method requires only a short period of normal EEG for training. In addition to a new proposed feature based on partial directed coherence and random graph theory, in this work, previously developed features used to characterize seizures are used as features in cumulative sum test for seizure detection. A total of 33 intracranial EEG recordings collected from a total of 9 patients corresponding to three different datasets have been used for the analysis purposes: (i) the first dataset includes 11 recorded EEG files (~12.5 min) from 4 patients; (ii) the second dataset includes 20 recorded EEG files (~30 min) from 4 patients; and (iii) two 24-hour long EEG files from a single patient. The proposed detector achieved a mean sensitivity and mean specificity for the first (0.77, 0.86), second (0.88, 0.9) and third datasets (0.92, 0.94) respectively. Statistical detection of seizures has shown success in detecting seizures without the need for highly customizable parameters or previously labelled EEG data. The proposed method could be used in real-time at hospital settings with a minimum requirement of training data. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eswa.2021.115551,10.1016/j.eswa.2021.115551,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85110528682&doi=10.1016%2fj.eswa.2021.115551&partnerID=40&md5=3215235dfed5fd4c333666971028b392,2021,28/03/2024 1:15,28/03/2024 1:15,,,,,184,,Expert Sys Appl,,,,,,,,English,,,Scopus,,,,,"<p>ASReview_relevant</p>; <p>Export Date: 13 February 2024; Cited By: 1; Correspondence Address: S.

However, epileptic seizures occur irregularly and unpredictably, automatic seizure detection in EEG recordings is highly required. In this work, we present a new technique for seizure classification of EEG signals using Hilbert-Huang transform (HHT) and support vector machine (SVM). In our method, the HHT based time-frequency representation (TFR) has been considered as time-frequency image (TFI), the segmentation of TFI has been implemented based on the frequency-bands of the rhythms of EEG signals, the histogram of grayscale sub-images has been represented. Statistical features such as mean, variance, skewness and kurtosis of pixel intensity in the histogram have been extracted. The SVM with radial basis function (RBF) kernel has been employed for classification of seizure and nonseizure EEG signals.

Instead of the traditional discrete wavelet transform (DWT), we attempt to explore the ability of double-density discrete wavelet transform (DD-DWT) to decompose the original EEG into specific sub-bands. The Hurst exponent (HE) and fuzzy entropy (FuzzyEn) are extracted as input features and then fed into two classifiers. On using these ranking non-linear features, the GA-SVM configured with fewer features is found to achieve the prominent classification performance for various combinations such as AB-CD-E, A-D-E, ABCD-E, C-E and D-E, achieving accuracies of 99.36%, 99.60%, 99.40%, 100% and 100%, respectively.

Approximately 30 % of patients cannot control their seizures using medication. In addition, since seizures can occur anywhere and at any time, caregivers must always be with the patient. Various researchers have developed seizure detection methods using multichannel EEG to improve the quality of life of patients and caregivers. However, the large size of the measurement device impedes transportation. We believe that a portable measurement device with a small number of channels is suitable for detecting seizures in daily life. Therefore, we need a system that can detect seizures using a small number of channels. The purpose of this research is to develop a seizure detection algorithm using a single-channel frontal EEG and to confirm its basic performance. We used EEG signals from a single electrode position (Fp1-F7, Fp2-F8), which is a bipolar derivation of the frontal region. We segmented the EEG using a 2 s sliding window with 50 % overlap and converted the segments into images. After preprocessing, we fine-tuned ResNet18, pre-trained on ImageNet, and developed an ensemble classification method. In the experiments with 10 epileptic patients (3 – 19 years old) registered in the CHB-MIT scalp EEG database, the results showed that the average sensitivity was 88.73 %, the average specificity was 98.98 %, and the average detection latency time was 7.39 s.

The proposed approach for classifying epileptic signals is based on transforming the EEG signal into a t-f image and the features related to t-f structures and shapes are extracted using HOG descriptor. The obtained feature is fed into SVM classifier with Gaussian kernel function for classification process. Further, the computationally efficient techniques based on local binary patterns(LBP) namely center symmetric LBP(CS-LBP) and local binary count(LBC) are also proposed to analyse the t-f representation of EEG signals. The histogram features extracted from CS-LBP and LBC are fed into SVM classifier. The performances of the proposed techniques are compared in terms of computational performance and detection rate of the classifier. Experimental evaluation on publicly available EEG dataset suggests that features extracted using HOG technique are more powerful in classifying epileptic and non-epileptic signals with an accuracy rate of 100%. Further, the obtained result suggests that proposed HOG technique outperforms the existing technique in the literature and attains better classification accuracy with an improved computational performance. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2018.",https://doi.org/10.1007/978-981-10-8660-1_71,10.1007/978-981-10-8660-1_71,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85049036660&doi=10.1007%2f978-981-10-8660-1_71&partnerID=40&md5=2c83aa634593b95f4aa50149a9753467,2018,28/03/2024 1:15,28/03/2024 1:15,,932-943,,,828,,,,,,,,Springer Verlag,,English,,,Scopus,,,,,"<p>ASReview_relevant</p>; <p>Export Date: 13 February 2024; Cited By: 4; Correspondence Address: S.

Electroencephalog-raphy (EEG) is widely used for detecting and localizing seizures. Almost all automatic detection methods pursue machine learning algorithms taking various features of EEG recordings as input. Previous studies focused on features in the time domain (e.g. variance), frequency domain (e.g. power spectrum), and time-frequency domains (e.g. wavelets, empirical modes). As an alternative, we present a dynamical system-based detection. From the perspective of a dynamic system, EEG is the output of a nonlinear system consisting of a network of neurons. The state of the system can be represented by a point in the phase space. Time evolution of the state creates a unique portrait in the phase space that captures the underlying dynamics of the system. In this paper, we have shown that entropy, as an important characterization of the dynamic system, of the EEG signals can be used to discriminate between the normal and seizure states.

It is an indispensable tool for diagnosing epileptic seizure. Manually reviewing EEG recordings for detection of epilepsy pattern is a time-consuming process. It is, therefore, necessary to automate the epileptic seizure detection. Further analyzing after the detection using large data set is a good supplement to the wide range of algorithms currently used for analysis. Seizure evolution is typically a dynamic and non stationary process and the EEG signals are composed of many frequency bands. The objective of this work was to determine features that differentiated epileptic seizure from a normal activity. Subjects suffering from a commonly occurring generalized epileptic seizure EEG segments and non seizure EEG segments are used for the study. The Spectral and Statistical methods are applied to the signal and the features are extracted. Spectral power, Standard deviation, Variance, Root Mean Square and Measure of Spread are the features that differentiate abnormal activity from normal activity whereas Median, Mode, Skewness, kurtosis are not able to differentiate.

In view of making the right decision on different issues, notably in the medical applications like epilepsy diagnosis, a functional approach to extracting the best aspects of EEG signals has been developed. There are two major steps in the suggested method: First, features are extracted and selected using enhanced 1D-LBP model that combines 1D-LBP adjacent models with PCA (1D-LBPc2p). The second step involves classification using random rotating forest ensemble classification algorithm. A comparison of the proposed method with 13 different reported methodologies, comprising uniform and non-uniform 1D-LBP, is carried out. In comparison to other models and classifiers, the results show that the technique described in proposed method has high detection rate as well as competence by giving high accuracy.

The proposed technique obtains harmonic multiresolution and self-similarity-based fractal features from EEG for robust seizure onset detection. A fast wavelet decomposition method, known as harmonic wavelet packet transform (HWPT), is computed based on Fourier transform to achieve higher frequency resolutions without recursive calculations. Similarly, fractal dimension (FD) estimates are obtained to capture self-similar repetitive patterns in the EEG signal. Both FD and HWPT energy features across all EEG channels at each epoch are organized following the spatial information due to electrode placement on the skull. The final feature vector combines feature configurations of each epoch within the specified moving window to reflect the temporal information of EEG. Finally, relevance vector machine is used to classify the feature vectors due to its efficiency in classifying sparse, yet high-dimensional data sets. The algorithm is evaluated using two publicly available long-term scalp EEG (data set A) and short-term intracranial and scalp EEG (data set B) databases. The proposed algorithm is effective in seizure onset detection with 96% sensitivity, 0.1 per hour median false detection rate, and 1.89 s average detection latency, respectively. Results obtained from analyzing the short-term data offer 99.8% classification accuracy. These results demonstrate that the proposed method is effective with both shortand long-term EEG signal analyzes recorded with either scalp or intracranial modes, respectively. Finally, the use of less computationally intensive feature extraction techniques enables faster seizure onset detection when compared with similar techniques in the literature, indicating potential usage in real-time applications.",https://doi.org/10.1109/TNSRE.2017.2697920,10.1109/TNSRE.2017.2697920,,2017-11,28/03/2024 1:15,28/03/2024 1:15,,2146-2156,,11,25,,IEEE Transactions on Neural Systems and Rehabilitation Engineering,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,<p>ASReview_relevant</p>,,,EEG; Electroencephalography; Feature extraction; fractal feature; Harmonic analysis; harmonic wavelet packet transform; relevance vectormachine; Scalp; seizure detection; Wavelet packets,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Yes,,,,Include,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A clinical finding through observation is relatively difficult and may lead to misinterpretations. In particular, epilepsy is the brain neural disorder which is hard to be diagnosed by visual observation of EEG signals. In an attempt to avoid such key issues, automated detection of epilepsy is proposed by analyzing EEG signals in a systematic way to support the clinical decision making process. Initially the EEG signal data is preprocessed by removing signal noise and artefacts by adopting selective threshold denoising method of Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT). Distinct statistical features are mined from each signal sub bands through multiscale approximation. The dimensionality of the signal features are reduced by using kernel based robustified Principal Component Analysis (PCA). A two-class Support Vector Machine (SVM) nonlinear classifier is used for classifying the ictal and interictal EEG signals with its two variants namely Polynomial Kernel and Radial Basis Function kernel. The performance of the various classification experiments are determined by computing of sensitivity (SEN) and specificity (SPE) and accuracy (ACC). The 5-fold cross validation is exercised to assess the performance of the classifier. Classification accuracy of 99.6% is obtained with the proposed model and outperforms similar benchmarking classification works reported recently. © 2022 University of Bahrain.

Because of its high disability rate and the long course of the disease, it is a worldwide medical problem and social public health problem. Therefore, the timely detection and treatment of epilepsy are very important. Currently, medical professionals use their own diagnostic experience to identify seizures by visual inspection of the electroencephalogram (EEG). Not only does it require a lot of time and effort, but the process is also very cumbersome. Machine learning-based methods have recently been proposed for epilepsy detection, which can help clinicians make rapid and correct diagnoses. However, these methods often require extracting the features of EEG signals before using the data. In addition, the selection of features often requires domain knowledge, and feature types also have a significant impact on the performance of the classifier. In this paper, a one-dimensional depthwise separable convolutional neural network and long short-term memory networks (1D DSCNN-LSTMs) model is proposed to identify epileptic seizures by autonomously extracting the features of raw EEG. On the UCI dataset, the performance of the proposed 1D DSCNN-LSTMs model is verified by cross-validation and time complexity comparison. Compared with other previous models, the experimental results show that the highest recognition rates of binary and quintuple classification are 99.57% and 81.30%, respectively. It can be concluded that the 1D DSCNN-LSTMs model proposed in this paper is an effective method to identify seizures based on EEG signals. © 2022 by the authors.",https://doi.org/10.3390/brainsci12121672,10.3390/brainsci12121672,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85144709358&doi=10.3390%2fbrainsci12121672&partnerID=40&md5=602c444b54eead2a70335d64531944b2,2022,28/03/2024 1:15,28/03/2024 1:15,,,,12,12,,Brain Sci.,,,,,,,,English,,,Scopus,,,,,"<p>ASReview_relevant</p>; <p>Export Date: 13 February 2024; Cited By: 4; Correspondence Address: Y.

Asaithambi,Automated EEG Analysis for Early Diagnosis of Epilepsy: A Comparative Study to Determine Relative Accuracy of Arithmetic and Huffman Coding Algorithms,"2021 Seventh International conference on Bio Signals, Images, and Instrumentation (ICBSII)",,,"Epilepsy is a prevalent neurological disorder typically characterized by recurrent seizure activity and detected using an electroencephalogram (EEG). The manual inspection of EEG however is a challenging and slow process that is susceptive to visual errors and variability amongst subjects. Hence, significant efforts have been made towards developing algorithms for automated epilepsy diagnosis and detection. The present study focuses on comparing two algorithms employing arithmetic encoding and Huffman encoding to separate epileptic signals from seizure-free (normal) samples. The proposed diagnostic technique comprises three major steps. In the first step, discrete wavelet transform (DWT) is used to decompose the EEG signal into detail and approximation coefficients. The second step involves computation of compression ratios using encoding techniques to convert the significant coefficients into bitstreams. Finally, the compression vector set is normalized and fed to a machine learning classifier that identifies seizure activity from normal, seizure free signals. The study utilizes the standard database for epilepsy as provided by the University of Bonn in order to validate the results against prior benchmarks. The proposed methodology with arithmetic encoding algorithm achieved 100% accuracy and the classification results vary from 30.6% to 100% respectively in case of Huffman encoding. Hence, a computer aided diagnostic (CAD) technique employing DWT along with arithmetic encoding and machine learning algorithms would form a robust diagnostic system in early-stage epilepsy diagnosis.",https://doi.org/10.1109/ICBSII51839.2021.9445169,10.1109/ICBSII51839.2021.9445169,,25/03/2021,28/03/2024 1:15,28/03/2024 1:15,,1-Jun,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,<p>ASReview_relevant</p>,,,Epilepsy; Support vector machines; Electroencephalogram (EEG); Feature extraction; Visualization; Machine learning; Machine learning algorithms; Discrete wavelet transform (DWT); Encoding; Arithmetic encoding; Computer aided diagnostic (CAD); Huffman encoding,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"2021 Seventh International conference on Bio Signals, Images, and Instrumentation (ICBSII)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Yes,,,,Include,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epilepsy is one of the brain's disorder. Automated diagnosis of epilepsy can be done by measuring and analyzing the nonlinear and non-stationary trends in EEG signals. This paper introduces a new diagnostic approach for analysis and classification of seizure and seizure-free EEG signals. In time-scale domain, the tunable-Q wavelet transform (TQWT) can reliably represent the sparsity in oscillatory signals. The proposed methodology begins with application of TQWT to efficiently characterize the non-stationary behavior and sparsity of EEG signals. TQWT decomposes the considered signals into a valuable set of band-limited signals termed as sub-bands for better feature extraction. Kraskov entropy is a nonlinear parameter to detect the presence of nonlinear trends in the signals. After decomposition, Kraskov entropy is computed from the specific sub-band as a decisive feature in order to discriminate seizure-free from the epileptic seizure EEG signals. Subsequently, obtained feature vectors are used for classifying the seizure and seizure-free EEG signals using the least square support vector machine (LS-SVM) classifier. While doing analysis, it has been observed that value of proposed Kraskov entropy based feature is significantly higher for seizure EEG signals as compared to that of seizure-free EEG signals. Furthermore, the experimental results of this work has demonstrated significant values of classification accuracy, sensitivity, specificity and Matthew's correlation coefficient. It is noteworthy that proposed framework uses single feature to diagnose the epilepsy accurately. Also the application of the proposed work on EEG data from the University of Bonn, Germany highlights the consistency and in some cases superiority of the proposed method over other popular methods. © 2017",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bspc.2017.01.001,10.1016/j.bspc.2017.01.001,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85010341342&doi=10.1016%2fj.bspc.2017.01.001&partnerID=40&md5=5a7ac33237d97af2c08eec2245b9a1aa,2017,28/03/2024 1:15,28/03/2024 1:15,,74-80,,,34,,Biomed.

The EEG data that is collected from the numerous patients who undergo this medical procedure is now considered to be part of big data as we know it. EEG analysis and detection of a data are finding numerous applications in today’s world, and few dedicated algorithms have already been developed to deal with this data. This study is aimed at developing a lightweight algorithm, with the sole purpose of comparing the accuracy in the prediction of the seizures from the EEG data, with data volume reduction. The endeavor is to filter out the essentials and exploit the capabilities of the existing algorithms like SVM and ANN, to distill out an algorithm that can achieve the aim of the project. The method proposes the use of sampling using fixed sized windows, to reduce the volume of EEG data that is handled for analysis, and extraction of the top-K amplitude measure from each of these samples. From the windows of 2 s each, top 60 values are sorted out for further analysis. These top-K values, along with the extracted features from the selected EEG, are then fed into the classification algorithms, with the aim of predicting whether it is a seizure or not.

This study explores the performance of the suggested method in signal representation, and it also investigates the discrimination ability of the proposal. To obtain the best tradeoff between classification results and computational complexity, a selection experiment for optimizing the embedding dimension d is introduced. Subsequently, simplified eigenvalues obtained from the symplectic geometry decomposition are adopted as vectors fed into a support vector machine (SVM) to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method. In the experimental processes, a comparison is made between the decomposition capacity of symplectic geometry under various intensities of artificial noise. Further, this study analyzes the efficiency and transferability of the proposed model for multi-class tasks with great clinical significance using different electroencephalogram (EEG) datasets, including the Bonn and (Children's Hospital Boston–Massachusetts Institute of Technology) CHB-MIT datasets. In all classification tasks for the Bonn dataset, the accuracies were greater than 99.17%. The average classification accuracy (ACC) and Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC) of 99.620% and 0.918 were respectively achieved using the CHB-MIT dataset.

Deep learning is a promising method to analyze large-scale unlabeled data. In this paper, we propose a multi-view deep learning model to capture brain abnormality from multi-channel epileptic EEG signals for seizure detection. Specifically, we first generate EEG spectrograms using short-time Fourier transform (STFT) to represent the time-frequency information after signal segmentation. Second, we adopt stacked sparse denoising autoencoders (SSDA) to unsupervisedly learn multiple features by considering both intra and inter correlation of EEG channels, denoted as intra-channel and cross-channel features, respectively. Third, we add an SSDA-based channel selection procedure using proposed response rate to reduce the dimension of intra-channel feature. Finally, we concatenate the learned multi-features and apply a fully-connected SSDA model with softmax classifier to jointly learn the cross-patient seizure detector in a supervised fashion. To evaluate the performance of the proposed model, we carry out experiments on a real world benchmark EEG dataset and compare it with six baselines. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that the proposed learning model is able to extract latent features with meaningful interpretation, and hence is effective in detecting epileptic seizure. © 2017 ACM.",https://doi.org/10.1145/3107411.3107419,10.1145/3107411.3107419,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85031320334&doi=10.1145%2f3107411.3107419&partnerID=40&md5=8de0244016f5efab068c46b61c060b6a,2017,28/03/2024 1:15,28/03/2024 1:15,,213-222,,,,,,,,,,,"Association for Computing Machinery, Inc",,English,,,Scopus,,,,,"<p>ASReview_relevant</p>; <p>Export Date: 13 February 2024; Cited By: 81; Conference name: 8th ACM International Conference on Bioinformatics, Computational Biology, and Health Informatics, ACM-BCB 2017; Conference date: 20 August 2017 through 23 August 2017; Conference code: 130145</p>",,,Deep learning; Electroencephalography; Epileptic seizures; Neurodegenerative diseases; Neurophysiology; Electroencephalogram; Epileptic seizure detection; Learning systems; Benchmarking; Biomedical signal processing; Feature extraction; Electro-encephalogram (EEG); Epileptic seizure; Time-frequency analysis; Physiological signals; Short time Fourier transforms; Bioinformatics; Time frequency information; Time frequency analysis; Sensor technologies,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"ACM-BCB 2017 - Proceedings of the 8th ACM International Conference on Bioinformatics, Computational Biology, and Health Informatics",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Yes,,,,Include,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Numerous algorithms using EEG signals to detect seizures have been developed in recent decades. However, most of them require well-designed features that highly depend on domain-specific knowledge and algorithm expertise. In this study, we introduce the unigram ordinal pattern (UniOP) and bigram ordinal pattern (BiOP) representations to capture the different underlying dynamics of time series, which only assumes that time series derived from different dynamics can be characterized by repeated ordinal patterns. Specifically, we first transform each subsequence in a time series into the corresponding ordinal pattern in terms of the ranking of values and consider the distribution of ordinal patterns of all subsequences as the UniOP representation. Furthermore, we consider the distribution of the cooccurrence of ordinal patterns as the BiOP representation to characterize the contextual information for each ordinal pattern. We then combine the proposed representations with the nearest neighbor algorithm to evaluate its effectiveness on three publicly available seizure datasets. The results on the Bonn EEG dataset demonstrate that this method provides more than 90% accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity in most cases and outperforms several state-of-the-art methods, which proves its ability to capture the key information of the underlying dynamics of EEG time series at healthy, seizure-free, and seizure states. The results on the second dataset are comparable with the state-of-the-art method, showing the good generalization ability of the proposed method. All performance metrics on the third dataset are approximately 89%, which demonstrates that the proposed representations are suitable for large-scale datasets. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.compbiomed.2020.104033,10.1016/j.compbiomed.2020.104033,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85092907572&doi=10.1016%2fj.compbiomed.2020.104033&partnerID=40&md5=f2479337cf52e070efcbbe6db5b84371,2020,28/03/2024 1:15,28/03/2024 1:15,,,,,126,,Comput.

Clinically reading tens or even hundreds of hours of EEG recordings is very time consuming. Therefore, automatic detection of seizure is of great importance. But the huge diversity of EEG signals belonging to different patients makes the task of seizure detection much challenging, for both human experts and automation methods. We propose three deep transfer convolutional neural networks (CNN) for automatic cross-subject seizure detection, based on VGG16, VGG19, and ResNet50, respectively. The original dataset is the CHB-MIT scalp EEG dataset. We use short time Fourier transform to generate time-frequency spectrum images as the input dataset, while positive samples are augmented due to the infrequent nature of seizure. The model parameters pretrained on ImageNet are transferred to our models. And the fine-tuned top layers, with an output layer of two neurons for binary classification (seizure or nonseizure), are trained from scratch. Then, the input dataset are randomly shuffled and divided into three partitions for training, validating, and testing the deep transfer CNNs, respectively. The average accuracies achieved by the deep transfer CNNs based on VGG16, VGG19, and ResNet50 are 97.75%, 98.26%, and 96.17% correspondingly.

The DL bypasses hand-crafted feature engineering, but extracts feature automatically from input images has displayed significant performance in various domain classification tasks. However, generating 2D images from 1D EEG signals and its quality assessment for DL pipeline has not been addressed properly, which is very crucial as the performance of the DL highly relies on input quality. Besides, suitable brain rhythm for seizure analysis has not been explored properly. Therefore, in this work, 2D input images have been generated by the RP technique from EEG signals for specific brain rhythms by preserving the nonlinear characteristics of EEG and employed a well-known DL, called convolution neural network (CNN). For, experimental validation, two well recognized EEG databases for seizure analysis from Bonn University and CHB-MIT (PhysioNet) have been considered. Eventually, three major parameters — recurrence threshold, time delay, and embedding dimension for an RP image generation have been evaluated and detailed. The results show that the proposed method can achieve classification accuracy up to 93%, which is significantly higher and the δ rhythm has been found suitable for seizure detection. The entropy of RP has been found as a suitable parameter for image quality assessment along with two global statistical parameters such as skewness of root mean square and standard of RP images. In performance evaluation, the proposed method demonstrates its competency by displaying the best classification accuracy compared to related works. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bspc.2021.102854,10.1016/j.bspc.2021.102854,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85109584151&doi=10.1016%2fj.bspc.2021.102854&partnerID=40&md5=88020ecdf7ff79a5ba7979051440d251,2021,28/03/2024 1:15,28/03/2024 1:15,,,,,69,,Biomed.

Therefore, much research is devoted to developing a computer-assisted diagnostic system to relieve the workload of neurologists. In this study, a kernel version of the robust probabilistic collaborative representation-based classifier (R-ProCRC) is proposed for the detection of epileptic EEG signals. The kernel R-ProCRC jointly maximizes the likelihood that a test EEG sample belongs to each of the two classes (seizure and non-seizure), and uses the kernel function method to map the EEG samples into the higher dimensional space to relieve the problem that they are linearly non-separable in the original space. The wavelet transform with five scales is first employed to process the raw EEG signals. Next, the test EEG samples are collaboratively represented on the training sets by the kernel R-ProCRC and they are categorized by checking which class has the maximum likelihood. Finally, post-processing is deployed to reduce misjudgment and acquire more stable results. This method is evaluated on two EEG databases and yields an accuracy of 99.3% for interictal and ictal EEGs on the Bonn database. In addition, the average sensitivity of 97.48% and specificity of 96.81% are achieved from the Freiburg database.

To overcome the problems, numerous automated seizure detection techniques, combining signal processing and machine learning, have been developed. Although 100% accuracy has been achieved for classifying non-seizure and seizure EEG records in up-to-date articles, the result of distinguishing normal, interictal and ictal EEG is still not satisfying. In this paper, a fusion method of variational mode decomposition (VMD) and autoregression (AR) based quadratic feature extraction was proposed for feature extraction and the random forest classifier was employed to hand with three-classification task. The raw EEG was decomposed into a fixed number of band-limited intrinsic mode functions (BLIMFs) using VMD, then a logarithmic operation was imposed on each BLIMF. Subsequently, optimal AR based quadratic feature extraction was conducted on all the BLIMFs and the extracted feature vectors were fed into random forest classifier for classification. Experimental results on the Bonn epilepsy EEG dataset show that the best accuracy of the proposed scheme is 97.352% and it outperforms than the fixed-order AR based feature extraction technique.

This paper focuses on adaptive seizure detection from EEG recordings. We propose a new feature extraction model based on an adaptive decomposition method, named intrinsic time-scale decomposition (ITD), which is suitable for analyzing non-linear and non-stationary data. Approach: Firstly, using the ITD technique, every EEG recording is decomposed into several proper rotation components (PRCs). Secondly, the instantaneous amplitudes and frequencies of these PRCs can be calculated and then we extract their statistical indices. Furthermore, we combine all these statistical indices of the corresponding five PRCs as the feature vector of each EEG signal. Finally, these feature vectors are fed into a feedforward neural network (FNN) classifier for EEG classification. The whole process of feature extraction proposed in this paper only involves one parameter and the role of the ITD method is based on a piecewise linear function, which makes the computation of the model simple and fast. More useful information for classification can be obtained since we take advantage of both instantaneous amplitude and instantaneous frequency for feature extraction. Main results: We consider the 17 classification problems which contain normal versus epileptic, non-seizure versus seizure and normal versus interictal versus ictal using a FNN classifier which only contains one hidden layer. Experimental results show that the proposed method can catch the discriminative features of EEG signals and obtain comparable results when compared with state-of-The-Art detection methods. Significance: Therefore, the proposed system has a great potential in real-Time seizure detection and provides physicians with a real-Time diagnostic aid in their practice. © 2019 Institute of Physics and Engineering in Medicine.",https://doi.org/10.1088/1361-6579/ab3e2e,10.1088/1361-6579/ab3e2e,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85072792030&doi=10.1088%2f1361-6579%2fab3e2e&partnerID=40&md5=33904222c5a0689ea4251391e2887aae,2019,28/03/2024 1:15,28/03/2024 1:15,,,,9,40,,Physiol.

Comput.,21945357 (ISSN); 978-981150028-2 (ISBN),,"Selection of suitable order of Daubechies (DB) wavelet for the decomposition of Electroencephalogram (EEG) signals to detect epileptic seizures is quite challenging, as experimentation is time-consuming. In existing methods, the selection of basis wavelet function for decomposition of EEG signals is carried out by considering the literature or by trial and error method. There is a very little significant literature which discusses the comparative analysis for the identification of suitable basis wavelet function (mother wavelet). However, the existing methods often fail to provide proper justification for selecting the mother wavelets. Hence, this research work addresses the fore-mentioned setback by identifying the suitable basis wavelet function based on wavelet selection methods for epileptic seizure detection. Further, the entropy-based features are extracted and classified using SVM, DT, ANN, and KNN with five complex cases (University of Bonn, Germany EEG dataset): A-B-C-D-E, AB-CD-E, C-D-E, AB-C-D, and ABCD-E. From the entropy analysis, it is evident that while extracting entropy-based features, tenth order of Daubechies wavelet (DB10) is found to be the most suitable basis wavelet function for the accurate detection of Epileptic Seizures. The performance metrics confirm the suitability of the identified basis wavelet function in terms of sensitivity, specificity and classification accuracy. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2020",https://doi.org/10.1007/978-981-15-0029-9_48,10.1007/978-981-15-0029-9_48,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85076830176&doi=10.1007%2f978-981-15-0029-9_48&partnerID=40&md5=62ef9be41c44ea34155f6e278f8f0a19,2020,28/03/2024 1:15,28/03/2024 1:15,,607-621,,,1045,,,,,,,,Springer,,English,,,Scopus,,,,,"<p>ASReview_relevant</p>; <p>Export Date: 13 February 2024; Cited By: 4; Correspondence Address: V.S.

Available databases contain noise, artefacts, different length & time EEG segments, associated comorbidities, clinical settings, and epilepsy/seizure types etc. Pre-processing of such continuous EEG segments requires significant amount of time and may feed redundant information (with reference to a seizure event) to the classification model leading to inaccurate, real-time seizure event detection systems. Hence, this paper proposes a metadata generation of large EEG databases (here, CHB-MIT EEG scalp database v.1.0.0) for ASDS. We elucidate the need to generate seizure sensitive data through peri-ictal and non-seizure EEG segments. This paper performs multi-variate analysis and two class (non-seizure and seizure event) classification between these fixed length and time EEG segments from support vector machine (SVM) and k-NN classifier.

Conventionally, the electroencephalogram (EEG) signals are manually studied by medical practitioners as it records the electrical activities from the brain. This technique consumes a lot of time, and the outputs are unreliable. In a bid to address this problem, a new structure for detecting an epileptic seizure is proposed in this study. The EEG signals obtained from the University of Bonn, Germany, and real-time medical records from the Senthil Multispecialty Hospital, India, were used. These signals were disintegrated into six frequency subbands that employed discrete wavelet transform (DWT) and extracted twelve statistical functions. In particular, seven best features were identified and further fed into k-Nearest Neighbor (kNN), naïve Bayes, Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Decision Tree classifiers for two-type and three-type classifications. Six statistical parameters were employed to measure the performance of these classifications. It has been found that different combinations of features and classifiers produce different results.

Investigating past attacks and predict future seizures can be done by exact classification between healthy and seizure based segments in electroencephalograph (EEG) recordings of these patients. Modeling EEG signal can help to extract discriminative features from it. These features make automatic classification more accurate. In this paper we propose a new modeling for EEG signals based on stochastic differential equations (SDE). In this statistical modeling, EEG signals are modeled with a self-similar fractional Levy stable process due to their inherent self-similarity. These processes are considered as response of SDE to the zero mean white symmetric alpha stable noise and inversely, by applying a derivative operator on these processes this white noise could be obtained again. We use a scale invariant fractional derivative operator for this purpose. Having fitted a probability distribution to the histogram of EEG signal after derivation, parameters of fitted histogram can be applied as features for classification task. We modeled healthy and epileptic segments of EEG signal from Bonn University database, and Neurology and Sleep Centre of New Delhi database. As an application of proposed model, we used features obtained from modeled signals to train an SVM classifier. Experimental result revealed highest classification of 99.8% for Bonn University database and 99.1% for Sleep Centre of New Delhi database, between normal and epileptic EEG signals.

The proposed method aims at extracting both the hidden inherent features within EEG fragments and the temporal features from EEG contexts. First, we segment the EEG signals into EEG fragments of fixed length. Second, we learn the hidden inherent features from each fragment and reduce the dimensionality of the original data.

The recent advances in sensor technologies allow researchers to analyze the collected biological records to improve the treatment of epilepsy. Electroencephalogram (EEG) is the most commonly used biological measurement to effectively capture the abnormalities of different brain areas during the EEG seizures. To avoid manual visual inspection from long-term EEG readings, automatic epileptic EEG seizure detection has become an important research issue in bioinformatics. Results: We present a multi-context learning approach to automatically detect EEG seizures by incorporating a feature fusion strategy. We generate EEG scalogram sequences from the EEG records by utilizing waveform transform to describe the frequency content over time. We propose a multi-stage unsupervised model that integrates the features extracted from the global handcrafted engineering, channel-wise deep learning, and EEG embeddings, respectively. The learned multi-context features are subsequently merged to train a seizure detector. Conclusions: To validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, extensive experiments against several baseline methods are carried out on two benchmark biological datasets. The experimental results demonstrate that the representative context features from multiple perspectives can be learned by the proposed model, and further improve the performance for the task of EEG seizure detection. © 2018 The Author(s).",https://doi.org/10.1186/s12918-018-0626-2,10.1186/s12918-018-0626-2,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85056976998&doi=10.1186%2fs12918-018-0626-2&partnerID=40&md5=88cf67642317a21c8e1f5efad45d9311,2018,28/03/2024 1:15,28/03/2024 1:15,,,,,12,,BMC Syst.

The diagnosis of epilepsy is usually made by a neurologist but can be difficult to be made in the early stages. Supporting paraclinical evidence obtained from magnetic resonance imaging and electroencephalography may enable clinicians to make a diagnosis of epilepsy and investigate treatment earlier. However, electroencephalogram capture and interpretation are time consuming and can be expensive due to the need for trained specialists to perform the interpretation. Automated detection of correlates of seizure activity may be a solution. In this paper, we present a supervised machine learning approach that classifies seizure and nonseizure records using an open dataset containing 342 records. Our results show an improvement on existing studies by as much as 10% in most cases with a sensitivity of 93%, specificity of 94%, and area under the curve of 98% with a 6% global error using a k-class nearest neighbour classifier. We propose that such an approach could have clinical applications in the investigation of patients with suspected seizure disorders.

Electroencephalogram (EEG) records the neurological activity in the brain and it is used to identify epilepsy. Visual inspection of EEG signals is a time-consuming process and it may lead to human error. Feature extraction and classification are two main steps that are required to build an automated epilepsy detection framework. Feature extraction reduces the dimensions of the input signal by retaining informative features and the classifier assigns a proper class label to the extracted feature vector. Our aim is to present effective feature extraction techniques for automated epileptic EEG signal classification. Methods In this study, two effective feature extraction techniques (Local Neighbor Descriptive Pattern [LNDP] and One-dimensional Local Gradient Pattern [1D-LGP]) have been introduced to classify epileptic EEG signals. The classification between epileptic seizure and non-seizure signals is performed using different machine learning classifiers. The benchmark epilepsy EEG dataset provided by the University of Bonn is used in this research. The classification performance is evaluated using 10-fold cross validation. The classifiers used are the Nearest Neighbor (NN), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Decision Tree (DT) and Artificial Neural Network (ANN). The experiments have been repeated for 50 times. Results LNDP and 1D-LGP feature extraction techniques with ANN classifier achieved the average classification accuracy of 99.82% and 99.80%, respectively, for the classification between normal and epileptic EEG signals. Eight different experimental cases were tested. The classification results were better than those of some existing methods. Conclusions This study suggests that LNDP and 1D-LGP could be effective feature extraction techniques for the classification of epileptic EEG signals. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bspc.2017.01.005,10.1016/j.bspc.2017.01.005,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85010641921&doi=10.1016%2fj.bspc.2017.01.005&partnerID=40&md5=21113c7a1099ffe55b7ed6005a77a961,2017,28/03/2024 1:15,28/03/2024 1:15,,81-92,,,34,,Biomed.

Most of the current seizure detection approaches strongly rely on patient history records and thus fail in the patient-independent situation of detecting the new patients. To overcome such limitation, we propose a robust and explainable epileptic seizure detection model that effectively learns from seizure states while eliminates the inter-patient noises. A complex deep neural network model is proposed to learn the pure seizure-specific representation from the raw non-invasive electroencephalography (EEG) signals through adversarial training. Furthermore, to enhance the explainability, we develop an attention mechanism to automatically learn the importance of each EEG channels in the seizure diagnosis procedure. The proposed approach is evaluated over the Temple University Hospital EEG (TUH EEG) database. The experimental results illustrate that our model outperforms the competitive state-of-the-art baselines with low latency. Moreover, the designed attention mechanism is demonstrated ables to provide fine-grained information for pathological analysis.

It manifests in the electroencephalogram (EEG) signal which records the electrical activity of the brain. Various image processing, signal processing, and machine-learning based techniques are employed to analyze epilepsy, using spatial and temporal features. The nervous system that generates the EEG signal is considered nonlinear and the EEG signals exhibit chaotic behavior. In order to capture these nonlinear dynamics, we use reconstructed phase space (RPS) representation of the signal. Earlier studies have primarily addressed seizure detection as a binary classification (normal vs. ictal) problem and rarely as a ternary class (normal vs. interictal vs. ictal) problem. We employ transfer learning on a pre-trained deep neural network model and retrain it using RPS images of the EEG signal. The classification accuracy of the model for the binary classes is (98.5±1.5)% and (95±2)% for the ternary classes. The performance of the convolution neural network (CNN) model is better than the other existing statistical approach for all performance indicators such as accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity.

Epilepsy disorder is characterized by the abnormal movements of human muscles, called seizure, as a result of the abnormality in the brain electrical activity. The electroencephalogram (EEG) can serve as a powerful tool for detecting Epilepsy. In this paper, the most commonly used Andrzejak database is utilized for building an automated system for epilepsy detection. Digital Wavelet Transform (DWT) is applied on the segmented EEG signals to extract the five EEG sub-bands (delta, theta, alpha, beta, and gamma). Approximation and Abe entropies along with line length are calculated for the extracted sub-bands. Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier with Radial Basis Function (RBF) kernel function is used to distinguish between three classes: (1) normal, (2) interictal (seizure free interval), and (3) ictal (during seizure). The best accuracies achieved are 93.75%, 98.75% and 98.125% for normal, interictal and ictal classes respectively.

An Electroencephalogram (EEG) is an electrophysiological screening method used for diagnosing epileptic seizure and further brain activities. Usually, physicians inspect the brain abnormalities. But this technique is highly time-consuming, has poor consistency, and has faced difficulty in detecting the seizure due to the imbalanced distribution of data. To overcome these issues a novel seizure predicting algorithm has been proposed. Initially, data is pre-processed using modified common spatial pattern (CSP) which will convert various channels into alternate channels. This in turn results in a maximized signal to noise ratio. For feature extraction, Dynamic Mode Koopman Decomposition (DMKD) and Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD) has been utilized by obtaining multiple IMFs (Intrinsic Mode Functions). A scheme called Novel Multilayer LSTM Discriminant Network is used for the classification process and is used for efficiently classifying featured vectors. The classification process is used for classifying ictal and non-ictal regions. To avoid misinterpretations and to reduce false alarm rate, post-processing is done. The performance of the proposed system is analyzed using various parameters such as accuracy, specification, sensitivity, Jaccard and other parameters. The proposed is compared with existing methods namely LMS (Least Mean Square) and Wiener in terms of PSNR (Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio), LMSE (Least Mean Square Error), Contrast-to-Noise Ratio (CNR) and error rates.

The classification of seizure and non-seizure signals is done on selected features using Decision Tree and k-nearest neighbor algorithms.

The proper brain signal classification using EEG finds helpful diagnose epileptic seizures. Since the traditional seizure detection process is a lengthy and challenging task, the automated identification of epilepsy is a significant problem. In order to resolve the issues that exist in the traditional brain signal classification models, this study designs Automated Deep Learning-Enabled Brain Signal Classification for Epileptic Seizure Detection (ADLBSC-ESD). The proposed ADLBSC-ESD technique aims to classify the brain signals to determine the existence of seizures or not. In addition, the presented model involves the design of the Improved Teaching and Learning-Enabled Optimization (ITLBO) technique for selecting features from EEG signals. Moreover, the Deep Belief Network (DBN) model is used for an effectual classification of EEG signals, and the hyperparameters of the DBN model are optimally tuned using the Swallow Swarm Optimization Algorithm (SSA). In order to ensure the improved brain signal classification performance of the ADLBSC-ESD technique, a series of simulations take place, and the outcomes are investigated concerning different measures. The experimental values highlighted the better performance of the ADLBSC-ESD technique over the current state of art techniques with maximum accuracy of 0.8316 and 0.8609 under binary and multiple classes, respectively. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.measurement.2022.111226,10.1016/j.measurement.2022.111226,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85129326878&doi=10.1016%2fj.measurement.2022.111226&partnerID=40&md5=e51797d69cd9e0277f282af8bb97d799,2022,28/03/2024 1:15,28/03/2024 1:15,,,,,196,,Meas J Int Meas Confed,,,,,,,,English,,,Scopus,,,,,"<p>ASReview_relevant</p>; <p>Export Date: 13 February 2024; Cited By: 12; Correspondence Address: J.

Xu,An Extended K Nearest Neighbors-Based Classifier for Epilepsy Diagnosis,IEEE Access,,2169-3536,"In the diagnosis of epileptic seizures, classification is an important step that directly affects the results. Visual inspection of Electroencephalogram (EEG) is a relatively common analytic method of epilepsy, but it is costly, time-consuming and relies on the experiences of the doctor. Therefore, the development of an efficient and accurate epileptic seizure automatic diagnosis system suitable for clinical diagnosis has become an urgent task. In order to better solve the problem of early diagnosis of epileptic and bring timely treatment to patients, the comprehensive representation of k nearest neighbors for multi-distance decision making (CRMKNN) is proposed in this research. In the proposed scheme, Euclidean distance and Hassanat distance are firstly used to select neighbors. Subsequently, the similarity distance is obtained through the linear representation of the nearest neighbors, and calculate the distribution of nearest neighbors in the category to get the discrete distance. Finally, the distance based on the comprehensive representation of the category is used to determine the category of the query EEG signal. In order to verify the method, we used the EEG signals from Bonn university public database and conducted experiments on six kinds of EEG combinations. Experimental results showed that our method could automatically detect seizure in all situations with an accuracy of not less than 99.50%.

This disorder mainly presents four kinds of events: pre-ictal, ictal, post-ictal, and inter-ictal. Epilepsy can be diagnosed through an electroencephalogram (EEG). Inter-ictal activity is one of the widely accepted epilepsy symptoms on an EEG. However, the differentiation between normal and inter-ictal EEG segments is difficult because they can have similar patterns. Also, EEG from patients with epilepsy can contain normal events. In this work, we built classifiers to differentiate between normal, ictal, and inter-ictal EEG. Using Discrete Wavelet Transform multilevel decomposition of the signal is done. At each stage, the vital features are collected from the approximation and detailed coefficients belonging to a certain frequency range where the epilepsy is identifiable. Some of the features are directly extracted from the EEG signal. The machine learning algorithm is used to train and test the wide range of classifiers that suits the signal.

Two methods are explored: a standard partitioning on a recent and larger version of the TUSZ, and a leave-one-out approach used to increase the amount of data for the training set. XGBoost, a fast implementation of the gradient boosting classifier, is the ideal algorithm for these tasks. The performances obtained are in the range of what is reported until now in the literature with deep learning models. We give interpretation to our results by identifying the most relevant features and analyzing performances by seizure types.

To realize this aim, a newly-developed time-frequency analytical algorithm, namely local mean decomposition (LMD), is employed in the presented study. LMD is able to decompose an arbitrary signal into a series of product functions (PFs). Primarily, the raw EEG signal is decomposed into several PFs, and then the temporal statistical and non-linear features of the first five PFs are calculated. The features of each PF are fed into five classifiers, including back propagation neural network (BPNN), K-nearest neighbor (KNN), linear discriminant analysis (LDA), un-optimized support vector machine (SVM) and SVM optimized by genetic algorithm (GA-SVM), for five classification cases, respectively. Confluent features of all PFs and raw EEG are further passed into the high-performance GA-SVM for the same classification tasks.

Sci.,03029743 (ISSN); 978-303045095-3 (ISBN),,"In this paper we propose a hybrid approach to detect seizure segments in a given EEG signal. In our model the discrete EEG signal is naturally associated with a piecewise linear function. We apply two data reduction techniques within the model space, a new half-wave method in the time domain, and orthogonal projection with the Franklin system in frequency domain. The later one is a complete orthogonal system of piecewise continuous functions. As a result we obtain two reduced piecewise linear functions with low complexity that still preserve the main characteristics of the seizures in the signals. Then the components of the feature vector are generated from the parameters of the two reduced functions. Our choice for the model space, i.e. the space of piecewise continuous functions, is justified by its simplicity on the one hand, and flexibility on the other hand. Accordingly the proposed algorithm is computationally fast and efficient. The algorithm is tested on 23 different subjects having more than 100 hours long term EEG in the CHB-MIT database in several respects.

The major advantage of choosing RQA is that, it provides better information even for short non-stationary and non linear signals where other methods fail to provide good results. And it requires no assumptions about data set size or distribution of the data. The algorithm is applied on epileptic EEG signal from CHB MIT database.

In most studies on this issue, the problem is simply regarded as a binary classification problem to distinguish ictal and non-ictal signals. However, EEG signals actually show characteristics of multimodal distribution, which should not be ignored in the detection. With consideration of the existence of such signals, a new workflow employing a k nearest neighbor algorithm and a generative adversarial network (GAN) is presented. The latter is developed to discern the ictal-like non-ictal EEGs before training the classifier. The GAN is used to find more implicit boundary-type samples. Consider the current task, a 16-layer CNN, which is the type most used to identify patterns in images and video, is transferred here to solve the problems of insufficient training data, long training time, and insufficient accuracy.

The manual inspection of EEG signals is subjected to human error and is a tedious process. Further, an accurate diagnosis of generalized and focal epileptic seizures from normal EEG signals is vital for the supervision of pertinent treatment, life advancement of the subjects, and reduction in cost for the subjects. Hence the development of automatic detection of generalized and focal epileptic seizures from normal EEG signals is important. An approach based on tunable-Q wavelet transform (TQWT), entropies, Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) and Artificial Neural Network (ANN) is proposed in this work for detection of epileptic seizures and its types. Two EEG databases namely, Karunya Institute of Technology and Sciences (KITS) EEG database and Temple University Hospital (TUH) database consisting of normal, generalized and focal EEG signals is used in this work to analyze the performance of the proposed approach. Initially, the EEG signals are decomposed into sub-bands using TQWT and the non-linear features like log energy entropy, Shannon entropy and Stein's unbiased risk estimate (SURE) entropy is computed from each sub-band. The informative features from the computed feature vectors are selected using PSO and fed into ANN for the classification of EEG signals. The proposed algorithm for KITS database achieved a maximum accuracy of 100% for four experimental cases namely, (i) normal-focal, (ii) normal-generalised, (iii) normal-focal + generalised and (iv) normal-focal-generalised. The TUH database achieved an accuracy of 95.1%, 97.4%, 96.2% and 88.8% for the four experimental cases.

A novel scheme to detect epileptic seizures from back ground electroencephalogram (EEG) is proposed in this paper. This scheme is based on discrete wavelet packet transform with energy, entropy, kurtosis, skewness, mean, median and standard deviation as the properties for creating features of signals for classification. Optimal features are selected using genetic algorithm (GA) with support vector machine as a classifier for creating objective function values for the GA. Clinical EEG data from epileptic and normal subjects are used in the experiment. The knowledge of neurologist (medical expert) is utilized to train the system. To evaluate the efficacy of the proposed scheme, a 10 fold cross-validation is implemented, and the detection rate is found 100% accurate with 100% of sensitivity and specificity for the data under consideration. The proposed GA-SVM scheme is a novel technique using a hybrid approach with wavelet packet decomposition, support vector machine and GA. It is novel in terms of selection of features sub set, use of SVM classifier as objective function for GA and improved classification rate.

The computation of spectral features from the subbands obtained from Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) are used as a feature for classifying the different classes of test signals. In this work, two different classification problems have been considered on bivariate signals. First problem is normal (N) and ictal (I) and second is normal (N), inter-ictal (IC) and ictal (I). Features obtained from the EEG signals of these classes are fed to the input of three different classifiers namely, Multilayer Perceptron Artificial Neural Networks (MLPNN) and Least Squares Support Vector Machine (LSSVM). For N-I and N-IC-I classes, we achieved 97.8% classification accuracy using MLPNN on focal and non-focal data from the University of Bern, Barcelona.",https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCSP.2018.8524471,10.1109/ICCSP.2018.8524471,,3/04/2018,28/03/2024 1:15,28/03/2024 1:15,,0585-0589,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,<p>ASReview_relevant</p>,,,discrete wavelet transform; Discrete wavelet transforms; Electroencephalogram (EEG); Electroencephalography; epilepsy; Feature extraction; Kernel; seizure detection system; spectral features; Support vector machines; Training,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2018 International Conference on Communication and Signal Processing (ICCSP),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Yes,,,,Include,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Rama Rao,EEG signal analysis for Seizure detection using Discrete Wavelet Transform and Random Forest,2017 International Conference on Computer and Applications (ICCA),,,"Epilepsy, a recurring disorder is symptomized by unprovoked seizures. Considered as one of the most common neurological disorders, Epilepsy affects people of all ages. Around 65 Million people across the world suffer from this disease. Manual diagnosis of EEG signals of long duration may be a source of error as well as a cumbersome task. Hence automation in Seizure Detection is essential for diagnosis of Epilepsy. Therefore, in this paper, an expert system for EEG signal classification has been proposed. The proposed system aims at classifying EEG signals into 3 classes-Normal, inter-ictal (EEG recordings of epileptic patients during non-seizure period) and ictal (EEG recordings of epileptic patients during seizure period). Discrete Wavelet Transform, a technique for analyzing signals in time-frequency domain has been quite successful in this respect for extraction of features from EEG signals. Further Envelope Analysis has been used on the DWT coefficients before feature extraction in order to elevate the performance of the system. Finally several Machine Learning techniques (E.g: MLP and Random Forest) have been used for classification of the EEG signals and the relative accuracy of these Classifiers with regard to this problem have been compared. The results from the experiments show that the Random Forest Classifier is the most effective classifier for this problem delivering an accuracy of 98%. The data that has been used for this work has been taken from the publicly available EEG database of University of Bonn which presents 100 single channel EEG records for each of the above classes.",https://doi.org/10.1109/COMAPP.2017.8079760,10.1109/COMAPP.2017.8079760,,6/09/2017,28/03/2024 1:15,28/03/2024 1:15,,369-378,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,<p>ASReview_relevant</p>,,,Discrete wavelet transforms; DWT; EEG; Electroencephalography; Epilepsy; Feature extraction; ictal; inter-ictal; MLP; Random Forest; seizures; Wavelet analysis,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2017 International Conference on Computer and Applications (ICCA),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Yes,,,,Include,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Electroencephalography (EEG) is a crucial component in the evaluation of epilepsy. Onset seizure detection is essential to prevent the seizure activity and improve patients' life quality. Presurgical treatment, precise assessment, seizure prevention, and emergency alerts all depend on the quick detection of seizure onset. Moreover, manual examination of EEG signals is boring and time-consuming task. Numerous automated epileptic seizure detection schemes have been developed to help neurologists. This paper focus on the realization of an efficient adaptive rate solution for the epileptic seizure detection. The signal is respectively digitized and segmented with an event-driven ADC (EDADC) and an activity selection algorithm (ASA). The segments are uniformly resampled and conditioned. In next step, the autoregressive (AR) Burg modelling is employed to extract the features. Afterwards, the extracted features are utilized for classification. It is demonstrated that the suggested system-processing load is adjusted as a function of the incoming signal disparities.

Analysis of epileptic seizures derived from long-term recordings of electroencephalogram (EEG) is cumbersome and time consuming for a neurologist. Therefore, introducing an automated detection system surrogate the neurologist involvement all time and speed up the treatment procedure. Methods: This study introduces a matrix determinant of EEG as a significant feature for recognition of epileptic seizures. Initially, artifact-free filtered EEG time series was arranged sequentially to form a square matrix of order, namely 13, 16, 23, and 32 and determinant was estimated. Assumed that the total elements in the square matrix represent a typical segmentation length. The experiment was conducted using EEG database obtained from the University of Bonn and Ramaiah Medical College and Hospital (RMCH). In total, eleven classification problems among non-epileptic group and epileptic EEG were composed to examine temporal dynamics of brain activity in different states of the epileptic activity. Next, the extracted feature was classified using support vector machine (SVM), K-nearest neighbor (K-NN), multi-layer perceptron (MLP) classifiers with 10-fold cross-validation. Results: Experimental results revealed the highest classification accuracy of 99.45% (using University of Bonn) and 97.56% (using RMCH). between normal and epileptic EEG. In addition, other classification problems and matrix orders showed better results using all the classifiers.

EEG signals which are representatives of complex human brain dynamics can be effectively characterised by MDFA. Here, EEG signals representing healthy, interictal and seizure activities are acquired from an available dataset. The acquired signals are at first analysed using MDFA. Based on the multifractal analysis, 14 novel features are proposed in this study, to distinguish between different types of EEG signals.

Wavelet transformation is used to decompose the input EEG signals into various sub-bands. The nonlinear features, namely approximate entropy, largest Lyapunov exponent and correlation dimension, are extracted from each sub-band. In this proposed work, sub-band specific feature subset that is reduced in size and capable of discriminating samples is selected by employing fuzzy rules. For classification purpose, a new LDAG-SVM is used for detecting epileptic seizure. Every sub-band has its own characteristics. If appropriate features which characterize the specific sub-band are selected, then the classification accuracy is improved and computational complexity is reduced. The important advantage of the fuzzy logic is its close relation to human thinking. Due to the lengthy record and intra-professional variability, automation of epileptic detection is inevitable. Fuzzy rules are the natural choice of employing human expertise to build machine learning system. Performances of the proposed methods are evaluated using two different benchmark EEG datasets, namely Bonn and CHB-MIT. The performance measures such as classification accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, execution time and receiver operating characteristics are used to measure and analyze the performances of the proposed classifier.

Then the three-dimensional phase space representation (3D-PSR) is reconstructed for each IMF according to the time delay method. At last, the kernel radius of the corresponding 3D-PSR is defined, which aims to characterize the concentration degree of all the points in 3D-PSR.

Since these continuous seizures may cause permanent brain damage, it constitutes a medical emergency. This paper proposes a method to detect nonconvulsive seizures for a further nonconvulsive status epilepticus diagnosis. To differentiate between the normal and seizure electroencephalogram (EEG), a K-Nearest Neighbor, a Radial Basis Support Vector Machine, and a Linear Discriminant Analysis classifier are used. The classifier features are obtained from the Canonical Polyadic Decomposition (CPD) and Block Term Decomposition of the EEG data represented as third order tensor. To expand the EEG into a tensor, Wavelet or Hilbert-Huang transform are used. The algorithm is tested on a scalp EEG database of 139 seizures of different duration.

In the existing literature, a number of automatic epileptic seizure detection methods have been proposed that extract useful features from EEG segments and classify them using machine learning algorithms. Some characterizing features of epileptic and non-epileptic EEG signals overlap; therefore, it requires that analysis of signals must be performed from diverse perspectives. Few studies analyzed these signals in diverse domains to identify distinguishing characteristics of epileptic EEG signals. To pose the challenge mentioned above, in this paper, a fuzzy-based epileptic seizure detection model is proposed that incorporates a novel feature extraction and selection method along with fuzzy classifiers. The proposed work extracts pattern features along with time-domain, frequency-domain, and non-linear analysis of signals. It applies a feature selection strategy on extracted features to get more discriminating features that build fuzzy machine learning classifiers for the detection of epileptic seizures. The empirical evaluation of the proposed model was conducted on the benchmark Bonn EEG dataset. It shows significant accuracy of 98% to 100% for normal vs. ictal classification cases while for three class classification of normal vs. inter-ictal vs. ictal accuracy reaches to above 97.5%. The obtained results for ten classification cases (including normal, seizure or ictal, and seizure-free or inter-ictal classes) prove the superior performance of proposed work as compared to other state-of-the-art counterparts. © 2022 Tech Science Press.

Because of higher temporal resolution, brain activities measured by electroencephalography (EEG) are usually utilized for confinement of seizures and distinguishing proof of epileptic dysfunctions. Detection of EEG seizures by using traditional Fourier-based methods and manual interpretation is tedious and challenging because of non-linear and non-stationary dynamics of EEG. In our research, at first, we have done robust statistical analysis to detect and classify the seizure and nonseizure. But, the result was not accurate enough to detect and classify seizure effectively. For identification of ordinary and epileptic EEG measurement, we approached a novel algorithm based on Hilbert vibration decomposition (HVD). HVD accomplishes Hilbert transform demonstration of instantaneous frequency and bring outs mono components that have particular time-differing amplitudes and instantaneous frequencies from non-stationary signals. Least squares support vector machine (LS-SVM) is used for identifying epileptic seizures in this research.

We tested the capacity of these estimates to correctly classify seizure intervals using a publicly available data set. Using the k-nearest neighbor classifier and testing with tenfold cross validation, we achieved 100% accurate classification. Our proposed CAD system outperformed the existing state-of-the-art models.

Firstly, 8th order Butter Worth Filter (BWF) is applied for removing artifacts from Bern Barcelona (BB), Bonn University (BU), and Temple University Hospital (TUH) datasets. Next, the swarm decomposition method is employed for signal decomposition where it provides a significant frequency localization by separating the essential signal components from the denoised EEG signals. Then, the semantic feature extraction is performed for extracting feature values from the decomposed signals. The feature extraction includes the benefits like reduction in overfitting risk, accuracy improvement, and speed up the training process. Further, the extracted multidimensional feature values are reduced by proposing enhanced Salp Swarm Algorithm (SSA), where it selects optimum feature values for classification. The enhanced SSA uses Whale Optimization Algorithm (WOA) for identifying the potential feature values from the multi-dimensional feature space. Lastly, the selected features are fed to the Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) network for classifying abnormality and normality of seizures.

Electroencephalographic (EEG) signals were recorded with electrodes on healthy, epileptic seizure-free, and epileptic seizure patients. The challenges in this field are generally regarded to be the impacts of non-stationarity and nonlinearity in EEG signals. To address these challenges, this study attempts to recognize different brain statuses. The idea originated from a novel hypothesis that considers EEG signals as convolution signals and regards itself as the generation mechanism of EEG signals, to some extent. Based on this hypothesis, the nonlinear problem can be viewed as a deconvolution procedure. As such, the method can be simplified into three parts: eliminating non-stationary is used to catch high-frequency to low-frequency signals, which is followed by a local mean decomposition (LMD) algorithm; these signals are deconvoluted to form ultra-high-dimensional feature sets, which is completely terminated by the mel-frequency cepstrum coefficients (MFCC) algorithm; and several classifiers are combined to achieve highly accurate recognition results and to verify the superiority and reasonableness of this method. The publicly available EEG database from the University of Bonn, Germany is employed to demonstrate the effectiveness and outstanding performance of this method. According to the results, the method has the ability to attain a higher average classification accuracy than other methods in all of the four following cases: healthy (datasets A and B) versus epileptic seizure (dataset E), epileptic seizure-free (datasets C and D) versus epileptic seizure (dataset E), healthy (datasets A and B) versus epileptic seizure-free (datasets C and D) versus epileptic seizure (dataset E), and healthy (dataset A) versus healthy (dataset B) versus epileptic seizure-free (dataset C) versus epileptic seizure-free (dataset D) versus epileptic seizure (dataset E). © 2018 by the authors.",https://doi.org/10.3390/app8091528,10.3390/app8091528,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85052814230&doi=10.3390%2fapp8091528&partnerID=40&md5=f884377a69f44314637e4f2d91a8332a,2018,28/03/2024 1:15,28/03/2024 1:15,,,,9,8,,Appl.

Since EEG signals are non-stationary, traditional machine learning approaches may not suffice in effective identification of epileptic seizures. The paper proposes a hybrid ensemble learning framework that systematically combines preprocessing methods with ensemble machine learning algorithms. Specifically, principal component analysis (PCA) or t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE) combined along k-means clustering followed by ensemble learning such as extreme gradient boosting algorithms (XGBoost) or random forest is considered. Selection of ensemble learning methods is justified by comparing the mean average precision score with well known methodologies in epileptic seizure detection domain when applied to real data set. The proposed hybrid framework is also compared with other simple supervised machine learning algorithms with training set of varying size. Results suggested that the proposed approach achieves significant improvement in accuracy compared with other algorithms and suggests stability in classification accuracy even with small sized data. © 2022 Institute of Advanced Engineering and Science.

Time series estimation to obtain the future samples of EEG signal has vital role for detecting seizure attack. In this paper, a novel density-based real-time seizure prediction algorithm based on a trained offline seizure detection algorithm is proposed. Methods: In the offline seizure detection procedure, after signal preprocessing, histogram-based statistical features are extracted from signal probability distribution. By defining a deterministic polynomial model on the normalized histogram, a novel syntactic feature that is named Interpolated Histogram Feature (IHF) is proposed. Moreover, with this feature, Seizure Distribution Model (SDM) as a descriptor of the seizure and non-seizure signals is presented. By using a novel hybrid optimization algorithm based on Bayesian classifier and Hunting Search (HuS) algorithm, the optimal features are selected. To detect the seizure attacks in the online mode, a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) classifier is trained with the optimal features in the offline procedure. For online prediction, the enhanced Recursive Least Square (RLS) filter is applied to estimate sample-by-sample of the EEG signal. Also, a density-based signal tracking scenario is introduced to update and tune the parameters of RLS filtering algorithm. Results: Our prediction algorithm is evaluated on 104 hours of EEG signals recorded from 23 pediatric patients. Our online signal prediction algorithm provides the accuracy rate of 86.56% and precision rate of 86.53% simultaneously using the trained MLP classifier from the offline mode. The recall rate of seizure prediction is 97.27% and the false prediction rate of 0.00215 per hour is achieved as well. Ultimately, the future samples of EEG signal are estimated, and the time of seizure signal prediction is also converged to 6.64 seconds. Conclusion: In our proposed real-time algorithm, by implementing a density-based signal tracking scenario, the future samples of signal with suitable time is predicted and the seizure is detected based on the optimal features from the IHF and histogram-based statistical features with acceptable performance. © 2016 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cmpb.2016.04.014,10.1016/j.cmpb.2016.04.014,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84964921442&doi=10.1016%2fj.cmpb.2016.04.014&partnerID=40&md5=a16ae7fa3aa27a2cf6c5d64f4f218c4a,2016,28/03/2024 1:18,28/03/2024 1:18,,115-136,,,132,,Comput.

Owing to its onerous and time-consuming nature, seizure detection based on visual inspection hinders epilepsy diagnosis, monitoring, and large-scale data analysis in epilepsy research. So, there is a dire need of an automatic seizure detection scheme. Method: An automated scheme for epileptic seizure identification is developed in this study. Here we utilize a signal processing technique, namely-complete ensemble empirical mode decomposition with adaptive noise (CEEMDAN) for epileptic seizure identification. First, we decompose segments of EEG signals into intrinsic mode functions by CEEMDAN. The mode functions are then modeled by normal inverse Gaussian (NIG) pdf parameters. In this work, NIG modeling is employed in conjunction with CEEMDAN for epileptic seizure detection for the first time. The efficacy of the NIG parameters in the CEEMDAN domain is demonstrated by intuitive, graphical, and statistical analyses. Adaptive Boosting, an eminent ensemble learning based classification model, is implemented to perform classification. Results: Experimental outcomes suggest that the algorithmic performance of the proposed scheme is promising in all the cases of clinical significance. Comparative evaluation of algorithmic performance with the state-of-the-art schemes manifest that the seizure detection scheme proposed herein outperforms competing algorithms in terms of accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and Cohen's Kappa coefficient. Conclusions: Upon its implementation in clinical practice, the proposed seizure detection scheme will eliminate the onus of medical professionals and expedite epilepsy research and diagnosis. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.knosys.2019.105333,10.1016/j.knosys.2019.105333,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85076251356&doi=10.1016%2fj.knosys.2019.105333&partnerID=40&md5=9c9feb95eb695269090051d13ae8a1a9,2020,28/03/2024 1:15,28/03/2024 1:15,,,,,191,,Knowl Based Syst,,,,,,,,English,,,Scopus,,,,,"<p>ASReview_relevant</p>; <p>Export Date: 13 February 2024; Cited By: 108; Correspondence Address: A.R.

Any damage has the potential to disrupt the workings of the brain and cause seizures. These epileptic seizures are the manifestations of epilepsy. The electroencephalograph (EEG) signals register average neuronal activity from the cerebral cortex and label changes in activity over large areas. A detailed analysis of these electroencephalograph (EEG) signals provides valuable insights into the mechanisms instigating epileptic disorders. Moreover, the detection of interictal spikes and epileptic seizures in an EEG signal plays an important role in the diagnosis of epilepsy. Automatic seizure detection methods are required, as these epileptic seizures are volatile and unpredictable. This paper deals with an automated detection of epileptic seizures in EEG signals using empirical mode decomposition (EMD) for feature extraction and proposes a novel genetic programming (GP) approach for classifying the EEG signals. Improvements in the standard GP approach are made using a Constructive Genetic Programming (CGP) in which constructive crossover and constructive subtree mutation operators are introduced. A hill climbing search is integrated in crossover and mutation operators to remove the destructive nature of these operators. A new concept of selecting the Globally Prime offspring is also presented to select the best fitness offspring generated during crossover. To decrease the time complexity of GP, a new dynamic fitness value computation (DFVC) is employed to increase the computational speed. We conducted five different sets of experiments to evaluate the performance of the proposed model in the classification of different mixtures of normal, interictal and ictal signals, and the accuracies achieved are outstandingly high. The experimental results are compared with the existing methods on same datasets, and these results affirm the potential use of our method for accurately detecting epileptic seizures in an EEG signal. © 2015 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cmpb.2015.10.001,10.1016/j.cmpb.2015.10.001,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84954475756&doi=10.1016%2fj.cmpb.2015.10.001&partnerID=40&md5=5c7f6111a6ae5d51941527519cbd6f84,2016,28/03/2024 1:15,28/03/2024 1:15,,Feb-18,,,124,,Comput.

Usually, neurologists employ direct visual inspection to identify epileptiform abnormalities. Therefore, electroencephalograms have been an essential integral to the researches which aim to automatically detect epilepsy. However, it is difficult because seizure manifestations on scalp EEG are extremely variable between patients, even the same patient. In addition, scalp EEG is usually composed of large number of noise signals which might cover the real features of seizure. To this challenge, we construct an 18-layer Long-Term recurrent convolutional network (LRCN) to automatic epileptogenic zone recognition and localization on scalp EEG. As far as we know, we are the first to train a deep learning classifier to identify seizures through the EEG images, just like neurologists direct visual inspection to identify epileptiform abnormalities. Furthermore, unlike the traditionally methods extracted features from channels manually, which neglected the association of brain's epileptiform abnormalities electrical transmission, seizures is considered as a continuous brain's abnormal electrical activity in our algorithm, from produce at one or several channels, transmission between channels, to flat again after seizures. The method was evaluated in 23 patients with a total of 198 seizures. The classifier shows reasonably good results, with 84% for sensitivity, 99% for specificity, and 99% for accuracy.

It results in different physical symptoms that are abnormal. Various antiepileptic drugs fail to minimize repeated patient seizures. The electroencephalogram (EEG) signal recordings provide us with time-series data set for epileptic seizure detection and analysis. These signals are highly nonlinear and inconsistent, and they are recorded over time. Predicting the ictal period (seizure period at the time of epilepsy) is thus a challenging task in the naked eye for the medical practitioners. Various machine learning techniques are applied to identify the seizure's occurrence and its classification in multiple domains. A classification model based on extreme gradient boosting (SCLXGB) is proposed here for the classification of the EEG signals. The SCLXGB model implements binary seizure classification on the benchmark dataset. Compared with K-nearest neighbor, linear regression, and Decision tree-based models, the proposed model achieves the best area under receiver operating curve (AUC) of 0.9462 and an accuracy of 96% which signifies accurate prediction of seizure and non seizure period. The proposed model SCLXGB was validated by taking different performance metrics to indicate the occurrence and non-occurrence of seizures in patients more appropriately. © 2022 Institute of Advanced Engineering and Science.

High-dimensional features will not only bring redundant information and noise, but also reduce the response speed of the system. In order to solve this problem, supervised locality preserving canonical correlation analysis (SLPCCA), which can effectively use both sample category information and nonlinear relationships between features, is introduced. And an epileptic signal classification method based on SLPCCA is proposed. Firstly, the power spectral density and the fluctuation index of the frequency slice wavelet transform are extracted as features from the EEG fragments. Next, SLPCCA obtains the optimal projection direction by maximizing the weight correlation between the paired samples in the class and their neighbors. And the projection combination of original features in the optimal direction is the fusion feature. The fusion features are then input into LS-SVM for training and testing. This method is verified on the Bonn dataset and the CHB-MIT dataset and gets good results. On various classification tasks of Bonn data set, the proposed method achieves an average classification accuracy of 99.16%. On the binary classification task of the inter-seizure and seizure epileptic EEG of the CHB-MIT dataset, the proposed method achieves an average accuracy of 97.18%. The experimental results show that the algorithm achieves excellent results compared with several state-of-the-art methods. In addition, the parameter sensitivity of SLPCCA and the relationship between the dimension of the fusion features and the classification results are discussed.

Wavelet transform-based features such as statistical values, largest Lyapunov exponent, and approximate entropy are extracted and considered as input to the classifier. In general, SVM provides better classification accuracy, but takes more time for classification and also there is scope for a new multi-classification scheme. In order to mitigate the problem of SVM, a novel multi-classification scheme based on hierarchical approach, with ELM kernel, is proposed.

However, current works on EEG-based seizure detection do not fully exploit the spatial–temporal information of EEG channels. In order to tackle this problem, we propose an automatic spatial–temporal epileptic seizure detection framework based on deep learning. Specifically, graph attention networks (GAT) are used as the front-end to extract spatial features. Thus, the topology of different EEG channels is fully exploited. Meanwhile, bi-directional long short-term memory (BiLSTM) network is used as the back-end to mine time relations and make the final decision according to the state before and after the current moment. Experiments are conducted on the CHB-MIT and the TUH datasets. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that the proposed model can effectively detect seizures from the raw EEG signals without extra feature extraction.

When the neurons get hyper excited, seizures occur causing a lot of inconvenience and trouble to the patient. For the study of the predominant abnormalities in the cerebral cortex of the brain, EEG is used widely. Due to the long nature of the EEG recordings, it is very difficult for the clinicians and visual experts to analyze the entire waveforms and hence automated detection of seizures from EEG signals came into existence. In this paper, the dimensions of the recorded EEG signals was reduced with the help of Power Spectral Density (PSD) and then the dimensionally reduced values are classified with the help of KNN Based Adaboost Classifier for the classification of epilepsy and the performance metrics are analyzed.

While electroencephalography (EEG) is an essential tool for monitoring epilepsy patients' brain activity and diagnosing epilepsy, Visual detection of the EEG signal to identify epileptic seizures is a time-consuming approach that might result in human error. Therefore, an early and precise epilepsy diagnosis is critical to reducing the risk of future seizures. This paper aims to increase epileptic seizure detection accuracy in a balanced dataset while reducing the execution time. To address this, we proposed a hybrid system of supervised and unsupervised machine learning algorithms to construct a computationally efficient and scalable model for the early detection of epileptic seizures from two-class EEG datasets. First, Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) was applied to the EEG signal to decompose it into frequency sub-bands. Then these EEG extracted features were fed into the Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) for partitioning these features into two clusters: epilepsy or not. Lastly, the clusters' output was evaluated with the random forest classifier. In addition, Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was used to reduce the EEG features and to reduce further the features obtained after conducting DWT on the EEG signal to determine the impacts of dimension reduction on this system performance. The experimental results show that the highest accuracy was achieved by the hybrid system of GMM with random forest with DWT features with an accuracy of 93.62 %. © 2022 Slovene Society Informatika.

As the electroencephalogram (EEG) reflects the brain activity of patients effectively, it has been widely used in epileptic seizure detection in the past decades. Recently, deep learning-based detection methods which automatically learn features from the EEG signals have attracted much attention. However, with deep learning-based detection methods, different input formats of EEG signals will lead to different detection performances. In this paper, we propose a deep learning-based epileptic seizure detection method with hybrid input formats of EEG signals, i.e., original EEG, Fourier transform of EEG, short-time Fourier transform of EEG, and wavelet transform of EEG. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are designed for extracting latent features from these inputs. A feature fusion mechanism is applied to integrate the learned features to generate a more stable syncretic feature for seizure detection.

Finally, the postprocessing is utilized on the outputs of the classifier to obtain more stable and accurate detection results, which includes Kalman filter, threshold judgment, and collar technique.

Xiang,Epileptic Seizure Detection With Permutation Fuzzy Entropy Using Robust Machine Learning Techniques,IEEE Access,,2169-3536,"The automatic and accurate determination of the epileptogenic area can assist doctors in presurgical evaluation by providing higher security and quality of life. Visual inspection of electroencephalogram (EEG) signals is expensive, time-consuming and prone to errors. Several numbers of automated seizure detection frameworks were proposed to replace the traditional methods and to assist neurophysiologists in identifying epileptic seizures accurately. However, these systems lagged in achieving high performance due to the anti-noise ability of feature extraction techniques, while EEG signals are highly susceptible to noise during acquisition. The present study put forwards a new entropy index Permutation Fuzzy Entropy (PFEN), which may delineate between ictal and interictal state of epileptic seizure using different machine learning classifiers. 10-fold cross-validation has been used to avoid the over-fitting of the classification model to achieve unbiased, stable, and reliable performance. The proposed index correctly distinguishes ictal and interictal states with an average accuracy of 98.72%, sensitivity of 98.82% and a specificity of 98.63%, across 21 patients with six epileptic seizure origins. The proposed system manifests the fact that lower PFEN characterizes the EEG during seizure state than in the Interictal seizure state. The study also helps us to investigate the more profound enactment of different classifiers in term of their distance metrics, learning rate, distance, weights, multiple scales, etc. rather than the conventional methods in the literature. Compared to other state of art entropy-based feature extraction methods, PFEN showed its potential to be a promising non-linear feature for achieving high accuracy and efficiency in seizure detection.

In this study, we suggested a real-time method for detecting epileptic seizures using electroencephalography (EEG). Various techniques, including the discrete wavelet transform and the methodology for calculating the eight eigenvalues, are used to extract characteristics at various sub-frequency levels. Then, a support vector machine is used to classify the user into one of three states (healthy, seizure-free, or seizure-active), and lastly, the RUS Boosted tree Ensemble approach is used to identify the start of a seizure in real time. An approach known as magnitude-squared coherence (MSC) fusion was created in order to identify EEG data. This algorithm was built on the basis of several statistical factors and crossing frequency properties. An additional perk is that the important features were first chosen with the assistance of a genetic algorithm. It has been determined whether or not the proposed approach is able to differentiate between normal and EEG patterns by using data obtained from the University of Bonn's EEG recordings.

This unwanted event can be obstructed by detection of electrical changes in the brain that happen before the seizure takes place. The automatic detection of seizures is necessary since the visual screening of EEG recordings is a time consuming task and requires experts to improve the diagnosis. Much of the prior research in detection of seizures has been developed based on artificial neural network, genetic programming, and wavelet transforms. Although the highest achieved accuracy for classification is 100%, there are drawbacks, such as the existence of unbalanced datasets and the lack of investigations in performances consistency. To address these, four linear least squares-based preprocessing models are proposed to extract key features of an EEG signal in order to detect seizures. The first two models are newly developed. The original signal (EEG) is approximated by a sinusoidal curve. Its amplitude is formed by a polynomial function and compared with the predeveloped spline function. Different statistical measures, namely classification accuracy, true positive and negative rates, false positive and negative rates and precision, are utilised to assess the performance of the proposed models. These metrics are derived from confusion matrices obtained from classifiers. Different classifiers are used over the original dataset and the set of extracted features. The proposed models significantly reduce the dimension of the classification problem and the computational time while the classification accuracy is improved in most cases. The first and third models are promising feature extraction methods with the classification accuracy of 100%. Logistic, LazyIB1, LazyIB5, and J48 are the best classifiers. Their true positive and negative rates are 1 while false positive and negative rates are 0 and the corresponding precision values are 1.

Certain cases will lead to death. The detection and diagnosis is therefore an important task. It can be performed either by direct patient activity during seizure or by electroencephalogram (EEG) signal analysis by neurologists. EEG signal processing and detection of seizures using machine learning techniques make this task easier than manual detection. To overcome this problem related to a neurological disorder, we have proposed the ensemble learning technique for improved detection of epilepsy seizures from EEG signals. In the first stage, EEG signal decomposition is done by utilizing empirical wavelet transform (EWT) for smooth analysis in terms of sub-bands. Further, features are extracted from each sub. Time and frequency domain features are the two categories used to extract the statistical features. These features are used in a stacked ensemble of deep neural network (DNN) model along with multilayer Perceptron (MLP) for the detection and classification of ictal, inter-ictal, and pre-ictal (normal) signals. The proposed method is verified using two publicly available datasets provided by the University of Bonn (UoB dataset) and Neurology and Sleep Center - New Delhi (NSC-ND dataset).

For this, various classification signal processing techniques have been developed in the traditional works. Still, they limit with the problems of increased complexity, reduced performance and insufficient classification rate. This motivates to design an automatic system for classifying the normal and abnormal EEG signals. Thus, an efficient machine learning approaches are implemented in this work, to overcome the existing techniques limitations. Here, an enhanced curvelet transform technique is established in order to overcome the disadvantage of Gabor and Wavelet transformations data loss and indiscriminate orientations. This method has the capacity to furnish the all the signals data required with no information loss of shearlet transformation and hence implemented to preprocess the given EEG signal, which smoothen the signal by eliminating the noise. Then, a modified graph theory, fractal dimension and novel pattern transformation techniques are employed to extract the features and patterns. The extraction of features is crucial for classification and compression of huge volume of EEG signal that possess low information. This theory improves the precision and speed of the computational technique. Most of the current research, Graph theory is reflected in the area of quantitative description of the time series data. It is predominantly employed for the reduction of noise and not affected during choosing the factors. From the patterns, the statistical features are extracted by using a standard gray level co-occurrence matrix technique that comprises entropy, homogeneity, energy, correlation and maximum probability. This method calculates the linear dependency of the adjacent samples thereby effective measurement of information loss in the transmitted signal is accomplished. Then, these extracted features are fed to the classifier named as novel random forest classification for detecting and classifying the signal as healthy, ictal and interictal.

Visual inspection and interpretation of EEGs is a slow, time consuming process that is vulnerable to error and subjective variability. Consequently, several efforts to develop automatic epileptic seizure detection and classification methods have been made. The present study proposes a novel computer aided diagnostic technique (CAD) based on the discrete wavelet transform (DWT) and arithmetic coding to differentiate epileptic seizure signals from normal (seizure-free) signals. The proposed CAD technique comprises three steps. The first step decomposes EEG signals into approximations and detail coefficients using DWT while discarding non-significant coefficients in view of threshold criteria; thus, limiting the number of significant wavelet coefficients. The second step converts significant wavelet coefficients to bit streams using arithmetic coding to compute the compression ratio. In the final step, the compression feature set is standardized, whereupon machine-learning classifiers detect seizure activity from seizure-free signals. We employed the widely used benchmark database from Bonn University to compare and validate the technique with results from prior approaches. The proposed method achieved a perfect classification performance (100% accuracy) for the detection of epileptic seizure activity from EEG data, using both linear and non-liner machine-learning classifiers. This CAD technique can thus be considered robust with an extraordinary detection capability that discriminates epileptic seizure activity from seizure-free and normal EEG activity with simple linear classifiers. The method has the potential for efficient application as an adjunct for the clinical diagnosis of epilepsy. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bspc.2019.101707,10.1016/j.bspc.2019.101707,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85074238680&doi=10.1016%2fj.bspc.2019.101707&partnerID=40&md5=a81e485fd789bc36f18ff193daa2d1d5,2020,28/03/2024 1:15,28/03/2024 1:15,,,,,56,,Biomed.

Though automated early recognition of seizures from normal electroencephalogram (EEG) was existing, no attempts have been made towards the classification of variants of seizures. Therefore, this study attempts to classify seven variants of seizures with non-seizure EEG through the application of convolutional neural networks (CNN) and transfer learning by making use of the Temple University Hospital EEG corpus. The objective of our study is to perform a multi-class classification of epileptic seizure type, which includes simple partial, complex partial, focal non-specific, generalized non-specific, absence, tonic, and tonic–clonic, and non-seizures. The 19 channels EEG time series was converted into a spectrogram stack before feeding as input to CNN. The following two different modalities were proposed using CNN: (1) Transfer learning using pretrained network, (2) Extract image features using pretrained network and classify using the support vector machine classifier. The following ten pretrained networks were used to identify the optimal network for the proposed study: Alexnet, Vgg16, Vgg19, Squeezenet, Googlenet, Inceptionv3, Densenet201, Resnet18, Resnet50, and Resnet101. The highest classification accuracy of 82.85% (using Googlenet) and 88.30% (using Inceptionv3) was achieved using transfer learning and extract image features approach respectively.

Electroencephalogram (EEG) signals are used to characterize the brain's state and detect various disorders. The EEG signals are non-stationary and non-linear in nature. Therefore, it is challenging to accurately process and learn from the recorded EEG signals in order to detect disorders like epilepsy. This paper proposed an automated learning framework using the Fourier-Bessel series expansion-based empirical wavelet transform (FBSE-EWT) method for detecting epileptic seizures from EEG signals. The scale-space boundary detection method was adopted to segment the Fourier-Bessel series expansion (FBSE) spectrum of multiple frame-size time-segmented EEG signals. Multiple frame-size time-segmented EEG signal's analysis was done using four different frame sizes: full, half, quarter, and half-quarter length of recorded EEG signals. Two different time-segmentation approaches were investigated on EEG signals: 1) segmenting signals based on multiple frame-size and 2) segmenting signals based on multiple frame-size with zero-padding the remaining signal. The FBSE-EWT method was applied to decompose the EEG signals into narrow sub-band signals. Features such as line-length (LL), log-energy-entropy (LEnt), and norm-entropy (NEnt) were computed from various frequency range sub-band signals. The relief-F feature ranking method was employed to select the most significant features; this reduces the computational burden of the models. The top-ranked accumulated features were used for classification using least square-support machine learning (LS-SVM), support vector machine (SVM), k-nearest neighbor (k-NN), and ensemble bagged tree classifiers. The proposed framework for epileptic seizure detection was evaluated on two publicly available benchmark EEG datasets: the Bonn EEG dataset and Children's Hospital Boston (CHB) and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), well known as the CHB-MIT scalp EEG dataset. Training and testing of the models were performed using the 10-fold cross-validation technique. The FBSE-EWT based learning framework was compared with other state-of-the-art methods using both datasets.

The main idea of the proposed algorithm is to combine a set of probabilistic classifiers, trained on a dataset of 1 s epochs, into a weighted ensemble classifier which can be used to analyze longer 5 s data segments. The method is trained and evaluated on 24 patients, all suffering from focal medically intractable epilepsy, from the Epilepsiae database.

Epilepsy is a brain disorder described by recurrent and unpredictable interruption of healthy brain function. Diagnosis of patients with epilepsy requires monitoring and visual inspection of long-term EEG by the neurologist, which is found to be a time-consuming procedure. Therefore, this study proposes an automated seizure detection model using a novel computationally efficient feature named sigmoid entropy derived from discrete wavelet transforms. The sigmoid entropy was estimated from the wavelet coefficients in each sub-band and classified using a non-linear support vector machine classifier with leave-one-subject-out cross-validation. The performance of the proposed method was tested with the Ramaiah Medical College and Hospital (RMCH) database, which consists of the 58 Hours of EEG from 115 subjects, the University of Bonn (UBonn), and CHB-MIT databases. Results showed that sigmoid entropy exhibits lower values for epileptic EEG in contrary to other existing entropy methods. We observe a seizure detection rate of 96.34%, a false detection rate of 0.5/h and a mean detection delay of 1.2 s for the RMCH database. The highest sensitivity of 100% and 94.21% were achieved for UBonn and CHB-MIT databases respectively. The performance comparison confirms that sigmoid entropy was found to be better and computationally efficient as compared to other entropy methods. It can be concluded that the proposed sigmoid entropy could be used as a potential biomarker for recognition and detection of epileptic seizures. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.compbiomed.2019.05.016,10.1016/j.compbiomed.2019.05.016,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85066277564&doi=10.1016%2fj.compbiomed.2019.05.016&partnerID=40&md5=121fc0813a0136d93e74232ffa78ac2e,2019,28/03/2024 1:15,28/03/2024 1:15,,127-143,,,110,,Comput.

With this strategy, the signals were decomposed into frequency sub-bands using discrete wavelet transform (DWT). principal component analysis (PCA) and linear discriminant analysis (LDA) are applied to reduce the dimensionality of EEG data.

Since epileptic seizures occur erratically, it is essential to develop a model for automatically detecting seizure from EEG recordings.

Epilepsy is the most widespread disorder of the nervous system, affecting humans of all ages and races. The most common diagnostic test in epilepsy is the electroencephalography (EEG). Objective. In this paper, a novel automated deep learning approach based on integrating a pre-trained convolutional neural network (CNN) structure, called AlexNet, with the constant-Q non-stationary Gabor transform (CQ-NSGT) algorithm is proposed for classifying seizure versus seizure-free EEG records. Approach. The CQ-NSGT method is introduced to transform the input 1D EEG signal into 2D spectrogram which is sent to the AlexNet CNN model. The AlexNet architecture is utilized to capture the discriminating features of the 2D image corresponding to each EEG signal in order to distinguish seizure and non-seizure subjects using multi-layer perceptron algorithm. Main results. The robustness of the introduced CQ-NSGT technique in transforming the 1D EEG signals into 2D spectrograms is assessed by comparing its classification results with the continuous wavelet transform method, and the results elucidate the high performance of the CQ-NSGT technique. The suggested epileptic seizure classification framework is investigated with clinical EEG data acquired from the Bonn University database, and the experimental results reveal the superior performance of the proposed framework over other state-of-the-art approaches with an accuracy of 99.56%, sensitivity of 99.12%, specificity of 99.67%, and precision of 98.69%.

However, in recent times, few works have been attempted on the classification of seizure types using deep learning (DL). In this work, a novel approach based on DL has been proposed to classify four types of seizures — complex partial seizure, generalized non-specific seizure, simple partial seizure, tonic-clonic seizure, and seizure-free. Certainly, one of the most efficient classes of DL, convolution neural network (CNN) has achieved exemplary success in the field of image recognition. Therefore, CNN has been employed to perform both automatic feature extraction and classification tasks after generating 2D images from 1D electroencephalogram (EEG) signal by employing an efficient technique, called gramian angular summation field. Next, these images fed into CNN to perform binary and multiclass classification tasks. For experimental evaluation, the Temple University Hospital (TUH, v1.5.2) EEG dataset has been taken into consideration. The proposed method has achieved classification accuracy for binary and multiclass — 3, 4, and 5 up to 96.01%, 89.91%, 84.19%, and 84.20% respectively.

Qaraqe,Automatic Detection of Ictal Activity in EEG Channels using Synchronization Attributes,2020 IEEE-EMBS Conference on Biomedical Engineering and Sciences (IECBES),,,"To aid doctors with the process of scanning long-term Electroencephalogram (EEG) records for seizure detection, automatic seizure detectors (ASD) have been proposed. ASD have many clinical uses and have gained much recent interest in the past few decades. However, due to high computational loads of the ASD algorithms; their real-time application has been hindered. The aim of this work is to build a detector that has low complexity and can detect seizures with high sensitivity and minimum latency. To this end, this paper proposes a patient-specific seizure onset detector that uses a single feature based on neural synchrony as it has been shown that once the brain approaches ictal activity, neural activity becomes less chaotic and more synchronous. Leveraging on this phenomena, the condition number is utilized to measure the synchronization between EEG channels. The developed detector has three main stages: preprocessing, condition number calculation and classification. After filtering an input EEG record, the condition number of an EEG window is computed and fed into a classifier that determines whether the current window is normal or abnormal. Classification was done by two forms of a support vector machine (SVM) classifier; namely, binary SVM and a one-class SVM. The developed detector was evaluated using the CHB-MIT dataset and was evaluated using 10 patients from this dataset. The proposed detector achieved a sensitivity of 97% and a maximum false positive rate of five false alarms per hour. The performance of the detector is comparable to seizure detectors that use multiple features; but lightweight for use for real-time processing of EEG data.",https://doi.org/10.1109/IECBES48179.2021.9398741,10.1109/IECBES48179.2021.9398741,,1/03/2021,28/03/2024 1:15,28/03/2024 1:15,,1-May,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,<p>ASReview_relevant</p>,,,EEG; Electroencephalography; Support vector machines; Feature extraction; Sensitivity; SVM; Real-time systems; Detectors; condition number; neural synchrony; seizure onset detection; Synchronization,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2020 IEEE-EMBS Conference on Biomedical Engineering and Sciences (IECBES),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Yes,,,,Include,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A real-time automated seizure detection system with minimal latency can help time the injection properly to find the seizure origin accurately. Reliable real-time seizure detection systems have not been clinically reported yet. We developed an anomaly detectionbased automated seizure detection system, using scalp-electroencephalogram (EEG) data, which can be trained using a few seizure sessions, and implemented it on commercially available hardware with parallel, neuromorphic architecture—the NeuroStack. We extracted nonlinear, statistical, and discrete wavelet decomposition features, and we developed a graphical user interface and traditional feature selection methods to select the most discriminative features. We investigated Reduced Coulomb Energy (RCE) networks and K-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN) for its several advantages, such as fast learning no local minima problem. We obtained a maximum sensitivity of 91.14% ± 1.77% and a specificity of 98.77% ± 0.57% with 5 s epoch duration. The system’s latency was 12 s, which is within most seizure event windows, which last for an average duration of 60 s. Our results showed that the CD feature consumes large computation resources and excluding it can reduce the latency to 3.6 s but at the cost of lower performance 80% sensitivity and 97% specificity. We demonstrated that the proposed methodology achieves a high specificity and an acceptable sensitivity within a short delay. Our results indicated also that individual-based RCE are superior to population-based RCE. The proposed RCE networks has been compared to SVM and ANN as a baseline for comparison as they are the most common machine learning seizure detection methods. SVM and ANN-based systems were trained on the same data as RCE and K-NN with features optimized specifically for them. RCE nets are superior to SVM and ANN. The proposed model also achieves comparable performance to the state-of-the-art deep learning techniques while not requiring a sizeable database, which is often expensive to build. These numbers indicate that the system is viable as a trigger mechanism for tracer injection. © 2022 by the authors.

Notes Electr. Eng.,18761100 (ISSN); 978-981191803-2 (ISBN),,"Epilepsy affects approximately 50 million people worldwide, is a neurological disorder associated with abnormal brain activity that result in seizures, unusual behavior, and every once in a while loss of consciousness. Seizures appear unexpectedly, posing a risk of injury and even death, particularly when they operate heavy machinery or drive a vehicle. As a result, developing a system that can predict the emergence of epileptic seizures is essential. Research on the identification of epileptic seizures using CNN can also be done by first translating EEG signals into 2D/3D images. To alleviate this challenge, we introduce a methodology that uses a 1D-CNN architecture to diagnose epileptic seizures based on raw EEG data. The 1D-CNN model consists of five convolutional layers followed by flatten and dense layers. The proposed method is tested using three scenarios, the first scenario is normal versus pre-ictal, the second is normal versus ictal, and the third is classifying EEG signal into three classes (normal vs. pre-ictal vs. ictal). The proposed 1D-CNN model delivers a great performance by providing precision, recall, and f1-score up to 0.99. The accuracy ranged between 94.9 and 96.30% for seizure detection scenario, 97.92–99.58% for seizure prediction scenario and 89.79–97.01% for three classes problem classification. This result indicates that the proposed method can be utilized as input to relevant stakeholders for additional clinical studies, and it may be employed in the medical field in the future. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.",https://doi.org/10.1007/978-981-19-1804-9_21,10.1007/978-981-19-1804-9_21,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85134342541&doi=10.1007%2f978-981-19-1804-9_21&partnerID=40&md5=acd0818cf3b385c81c9881fdf2a1e3f8,2022,28/03/2024 1:15,28/03/2024 1:15,,265-277,,,898,,,,,,,,Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH,,English,,,Scopus,,,,,"<p>ASReview_relevant</p>; <p>Export Date: 13 February 2024; Cited By: 0; Correspondence Address: N.K.C.

Notes Bioeng.,2195271X (ISSN); 978-981156328-7 (ISBN),,"Among the major brain abnormalities that have been identified, various remedial strategies are proposed to tackle most of such conditions. One of the serious abnormalities of the nervous system is epilepsy, which causes electrical distraction and strains the neural system. Usually, epilepsy is determined by the neurologist by analyzing the EEG signals grabbed from the brain. The task is very challenging as it requires continuous examination and connotation of the EEG signal of an epileptic patient. Hence, the development of efficient automatic systems is currently a bottom neck issue, which can recognize the epileptic seizure attack and distinguish between normal condition and epileptic seizure condition. Over the years, efforts have been made to establish an automatic system for precise detection and classification of an epileptic seizure. In the present work, a range of statistical, entropy, and fractal-based attributes are calculated from the coefficients of selected wavelet. The classifiers used in the paper are trained on the selected features as well as full features. The objective of the study is the selection of appropriate features and applying Tree, SVM, KNN, BPANN algorithm for the classification. Features are ranked with the help of Information Gain, Relief F, and Correlation attributes ranking techniques. Using Information Gain and Relief F feature ranking technique with 10-fold cross-validation, the classification accuracy of 100% was achieved by Backpropagation Artificial Neural Network (BPANN) for classifying epileptic and normal EEG signals. © 2021, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.",https://doi.org/10.1007/978-981-15-6329-4_34,10.1007/978-981-15-6329-4_34,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85092260004&doi=10.1007%2f978-981-15-6329-4_34&partnerID=40&md5=d3066284bfb26000935eaf4f22164146,2021,28/03/2024 1:15,28/03/2024 1:15,,413-424,,,,,,,,,,,Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH,,English,,,Scopus,,,,,"<p>ASReview_relevant</p>; <p>Export Date: 13 February 2024; Cited By: 0; Correspondence Address: S.

When a candidate seizure segment is detected, channel localization is also evaluated to assess its activation pattern providing feedback to the clinician regarding potential seizure onset area.

However, most of the existing methods are failed to trade off the effectivity and computation cost, which is not appropriate for on-line application. In this research, we propose a novel method for dealing with 3-class electroencephalogram (EEG) problem, based upon kernel density estimation (KDE) and least squares support vector machine (LS-SVM). The filtered EEG is decomposed into several sub-bands by wavelet packet transform (WPT), then KDE is explored to calculate the corresponding probability density. Five parameters are employed for EEG representation: the maximum (Max), the skewness (Ske), the kurtosis (Kur), the energy (En), and the central moment (CM). And significant features selected by Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) are fed to LS-SVM for pattern recognition. Furthermore, eight types of wavelet bases and four well-known functions are considered for feature extraction. Experimental results show that our approach has achieved satisfactory and comparable results for all validation methods when configured with coiflet of order 1 and uniform kernel. The highest accuracy of 10-fold cross-validation and standard 50-50 methodology is 99.40% and 99.60% with 27 and 26 features, respectively. As compared to previous literature, our proposed scheme is more suitable for diagnosis of epilepsy with higher accuracy and less number of feature that can be extracted with less computational cost.

Traditional diagnosis methods mostly depended on the professional neurologists’ reading of the electroencephalogram (EEG), which was time-consuming, inefficient, and subjective. In recent years, automatic epilepsy diagnosis of EEG by deep learning had attracted more and more attention. But the potential of deep neural networks in seizure detection had not been fully developed. Methods: In this article, we used a one-dimensional convolutional neural network (1-D CNN) to replace the residual network architecture’s traditional convolutional neural network (CNN). Moreover, we combined the Independent recurrent neural network (indRNN) and CNN to form a new residual network architecture-independent convolutional recurrent neural network (RCNN). Our model can achieve an automatic diagnosis of epilepsy EEG. Firstly, the important features of EEG were learned by using the residual network architecture of 1-D CNN. Then the relationship between the sequences were learned by using the recurrent neural network. Finally, the model outputted the classification results. Results: On the small sample data sets of Bonn University, our method was superior to the baseline methods and achieved 100% classification accuracy, 100% classification specificity. For the noisy real-world data, our method also exhibited powerful performance. Conclusion: The model we proposed can quickly and accurately identify the different periods of EEG in an ideal condition and the real-world condition. The model can provide automatic detection capabilities for clinical epilepsy EEG detection.

The proposed method is evaluated on the Bonn University dataset with six classification combinations and also on the Freiburg dataset. The tunable-Q wavelet transform (TQWT) is employed to decompose the EEG signals into different sub-bands. In the feature extraction step, 13 different fuzzy entropies are calculated from different sub-bands of TQWT, and their computational complexities are calculated to help researchers choose the best set for various tasks. In the following, an autoencoder (AE) with six layers is employed for dimensionality reduction.

The present work is focused on designing an efficient algorithm for automatic seizure detection by using electroencephalogram (EEG) as a noninvasive procedure to record neuronal activities in the brain. EEG signals' underlying dynamics are extracted to differentiate healthy and seizure EEG signals. Shannon entropy, collision entropy, transfer entropy, conditional probability, and Hjorth parameter features are extracted from subbands of tunable Q wavelet transform. Efficient decomposition level for different feature vector is selected using the Kruskal-Wallis test to achieve good classification. Different features are combined using the discriminant correlation analysis fusion technique to form a single fused feature vector. The accuracy of the proposed approach is higher for Q=2 and J=10. Transfer entropy is observed to be significant for different class combinations. Proposed approach achieved 100% accuracy in classifying healthy-seizure EEG signal using simple and robust features and hidden Markov model with less computation time. The proposed approach efficiency is evaluated in classifying seizure and non-seizure surface EEG signals.

Biol., Health Inform.",978-145035794-4 (ISBN),,"The analysis of electroencephalogram (EEG) signal plays a crucial role in epileptic seizure detection. Researchers have proposed many machine learning and deep learning based automatic epileptic seizure detection methods. However, these schemes, especially the deep learning based ones, suffer from labeling huge amounts of training data. Moreover, in epileptic seizure detection, physicians pay more attention to abnormal signals than normal signals, and thus the misclassification cost for them should be different. To address these issues, we propose a cost-sensitive deep active learning scheme to detect the epileptic seizure. In particular, we develop a new generic double-deep neural network (double-DNN) to obtain the cost-sensitive utility for the samples selection strategy in the labeling process. We further employ three types of fundamental neural networks, i.e., one-dimensional convolutional neural networks (1D CNNs), recurrent neural networks with long short-term memory (LSTM) units, and recurrent neural networks with gated recurrent units (GRU), in the double-DNN and evaluate their performances. Experiment results show that the proposed scheme can reduce the amount of labeled samples by up to 33% and 80% compared with uncertainty sampling and random sampling, respectively. © 2018 ACM.",https://doi.org/10.1145/3233547.3233566,10.1145/3233547.3233566,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85056094026&doi=10.1145%2f3233547.3233566&partnerID=40&md5=4530edaaef61cf20132a5c3f8bc180c9,2018,28/03/2024 1:18,28/03/2024 1:18,,226-235,,,,,,,,,,,"Association for Computing Machinery, Inc",,English,,,Scopus,,,,,"<p>ASReview_relevant</p>; <p>Export Date: 13 February 2024; Cited By: 39; Conference name: 9th ACM International Conference on Bioinformatics, Computational Biology, and Health Informatics, ACM-BCB 2018; Conference date: 29 August 2018 through 1 September 2018; Conference code: 140345</p>",,,EEG; Deep learning; Electroencephalography; Epileptic seizures; Neurodegenerative diseases; Neurophysiology; Epileptic seizure detection; Long short-term memory; Convolutional neural network; Deep neural networks; Electroencephalogram signals; Active learning; Active Learning; One dimensional; Bioinformatics; Active learning scheme; Misclassification costs; Uncertainty samplings,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"ACM-BCB 2018 - Proceedings of the 2018 ACM International Conference on Bioinformatics, Computational Biology, and Health Informatics",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Yes,,,,Include,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, we aim at investigating the spatial-temporal synchronization pattern in epileptic human brains using the spectral graph theoretic features extracted from scalp EEG and developing an efficient multivariate approach for detecting seizure onsets in real time. Methods: A complex network model is used for representing the recurrence pattern of EEG signals, based on which the temporal synchronization patterns are quantified using the spectral graph theoretic features. Furthermore, a statistical control chart is applied to the extracted features overtime for monitoring the transits from normal to epileptic states in multivariate EEG systems. Results: Our method is tested on 23 patients from CHB-MIT Scalp EEG database. The results show that the graph theoretic feature yields a high sensitivity (~98%) and low latency (~6 s) on average, and seizure onsets in 18 patients are 100% detected. Conclusion: Our approach validates the increased temporal synchronization in epileptic EEG and achieves a comparable detection performance to previous studies. Significance: We characterize the temporal synchronization patterns of epileptic EEG using spectral network metrics.

This paper proposes a method which constructs a multi-layer network and extracts the same features in each network optimized by improved genetic algorithm (IGA). Among them, the multi-layer network refers to the three-layer network constructed by pearson correlation coefficient, mutual information and permutation disalignment index respectively. There is a lack of research on the fusion and comparison of different networks in previous studies. Therefore, this paper analyzes the effectiveness of different networks by studying the fusion relationship of different networks, and further uses IGA for iterative optimization with constraints to weight the network and features, and finally uses the random forest classifier to automatically detect epileptic seizures.

Statistical dependence between different brain regions measures by functional brain connectivity (FBC). Specific directional effects cannot be considered by FBC, and thus effective brain connectivity (EBC) is used to measure causal dependencies between brain regions. Our main purpose is to provide a reliable automatic seizure detection approach. Methods: In this study, three new methods are provided. Multi-level modular network (MLMN) is proposed based on combining various EBC classification results at different frequencies. Another method named “modular effective neural networks (MENN).” This method combines the classification results of the three different EBCs at a specific frequency. “Modular frequency neural networks (MFNN)” is another method that combines the classification results of specific EBC at seven different frequencies. Results: The mean accuracies of MFNN are 97.14 %, 98.53 %, and 97.91 % using directed transfer function (DTF), directed coherence (DC), and generalized partial directed coherence (GPDC), respectively. By using MENN method, the highest mean accuracy is 98.34 %. Finally, MLMN has the highest mean accuracy, which is equal to 99.43. To the best of our knowledge, the proposed method is a new method that provides the highest accuracy in comparison to other studies – that used the MIT-CHB database. Conclusion and significance: The knowledge of structure-function relationships between different areas of the brain is necessary for characterizing the underlying dynamics. Hence, features based on EBC can provide a more reliable automatic seizure detection approach. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bspc.2020.101878,10.1016/j.bspc.2020.101878,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85079883851&doi=10.1016%2fj.bspc.2020.101878&partnerID=40&md5=87cdccfe48374daffe078f45c9e65bfe,2020,28/03/2024 1:15,28/03/2024 1:15,,,,,59,,Biomed.

A large number of EEGs have been recorded in clinical applications, which leads to visual inspection of huge volumes of EEG not routinely possible. Hence, automated detection of epileptic seizure has become a goal of many researchers for a long time. A novel method is therefore proposed to construct a patient-specific detector based on spatial-temporal complexity analysis, involving two commonly used entropy-based complexity analysis methods, which are permutation entropy (PE) and sample entropy (SE). The performance of spatial-temporal complexity method is evaluated on a shared dataset. Results suggest that the proposed epilepsy detectors achieve promising performance: the average sensitivities of PE and SE in 23 patients are 99% and 96.6%, respectively. Moreover, both methods can accurately recognize almost all the seizure-free EEG.

There is much difficulty involved in its detection. Here, a sequential processing feature extraction method and a novel multiplicative extreme learning machine are proposed for using in the electroencephalogram (EEG) classification process towards epileptic seizure detection. Firstly, a discrete wavelet transform (DWT) algorithm based on the frequency decomposition is used to obtain the sub-band wavelet coefficients. Secondly, two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) phase space reconstruction (PSR) of the sub-band are calculated to reveal the nonlinear chaos characteristics of signals in the high dimension. Thirdly, and differing from other statistical methods, the singular values are calculated based on the covariance matrix of 2D or 3D phase space as features that reduce the correlation of each dimension and which demonstrate the crucial variance in the original EEG signals. A combination of the proposed sequential methods can extract the significant features of epileptic seizure signals for classification. Finally, a novel multiplicative extreme learning machine (M-ELM) is proposed for using in the classification process. As compared with the normal ELM, support vector machine (SVM) with different kernels and backpropagation (BP) neural networks, the use of M-ELM can further improve the classification accuracy rate of the seizure signals, seizure free signals and healthy signals from the public dataset.

In addition, we developed a patient-independent seizure detection algorithm using Freiburg EEG database. Each patient contains datasets called “ictal” and “interictal”. Window length of 16 s was applied to extract EEG segments from datasets of each patient. Furthermore, Power Spectral Density (PSD) of each EEG segment was estimated using different spectral analysis methods. Afterwards, these values were fed as input to different machine learning methods that were responsible for seizure detection. We also applied MSPCA de-noising method to EEG segments prior to PSD estimation to determine if MSPCA can further enhance the classifiers’ performance. The MSPCA drastically improved both the sensitivity and the specificity, increasing the overall accuracy of all three classifiers up to 20 %. The best overall detection accuracy (99.59 %) was achieved when Eigenvector analysis was used for frequency estimation, and C4.5 as a classifier. The experiment results show that MSPCA is an effective de-noising method for improving the classification performance in epileptic seizure detection. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media New York.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s10916-014-0131-0,10.1007/s10916-014-0131-0,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84919932058&doi=10.1007%2fs10916-014-0131-0&partnerID=40&md5=fe43f32131456dae5c614448d40cf132,2014,28/03/2024 1:15,28/03/2024 1:15,,,,10,38,,J.

The separation of epileptic and non-epileptic activity and the identification of the form of the epileptic activity on the electroencephalogram (EEG) plays an essential role in providing correct treatment to patients. At the same time, detection of epileptic seizures is very important for patients. In this study, a method to classify EEG data using deep neural network architecture is presented. In the presented method, bidirectional long-term memory (Bi-LSTM), a type of recurrent neural network (RNN) was used. Single-layer Bi-LSTM architecture memory units, neural numbers and learning algorithms were modeled. After determining the architectural hyperparameters, the single layer 10-neurons Bi-LSTM approach is proposed as the optimum model. In this model, the effect of both optimization algorithms on classification success and changing the number of neurons on performance was investigated. In the classification between epileptic activity and other activities, the success rate was 96%, success rate in binary classification 99% and the mean success rate for classification was 97.78%. Unlike previous work, this study did not just focus on success rates. In addition, the importance of determining the hyperparameters (selection of optimization algorithms, initial learning rate, number of neurons) in the Bi-LSTM model was highlighted and the effects of these choices on accuracy rates was determined. Success rate and processing load were examined in detail. This study, which emphasizes the importance of parameter optimization, provides an important perspective to this research area. © 2021",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bspc.2021.103462,10.1016/j.bspc.2021.103462,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85122472139&doi=10.1016%2fj.bspc.2021.103462&partnerID=40&md5=8fedd39ed06185169d8ab57f7a8cb4f0,2022,28/03/2024 1:15,28/03/2024 1:15,,,,,73,,Biomed.

By analyzing the encephalogram (EEG) signals of patients with epilepsy, their conditions can be monitored and seizure can be detected and intervened in time. As the identification of effective features in EEG signals is important for accurate seizure detection, this paper proposes a multi-view deep feature extraction method in attempt to achieve this goal. The method first uses fast Fourier transform (FFT) and wavelet packet decomposition (WPD) to construct the initial multi-view features. Convolutional neural network (CNN) is then used to automatically learn deep features from the initial multi-view features, which reduces the dimensionality and obtain the features with better seizure identification ability. Furthermore, the multi-view Takagi-Sugeno-Kang fuzzy system (MV-TSK-FS), an interpretable rule-based classifier, is used to construct a classification model with strong generalizability based on the deep multi-view features obtained. Experimental studies show that the classification accuracy of the proposed multi-view deep feature extraction method is at least 1% higher than that of common feature extraction methods such as principal component analysis (PCA), FFT and WPD.

The introduction of automatic computerized process is required to analyze the EEG signals for detecting the seizure disorder. For obtaining the accurate classification result, the features should be carefully extracted. Though it is better to take many features in order to obtain clear and detail information of the signal, the classifier performance will be affected when large number of features is applied.

The proposed method consists of three stages. First, a multirate filterbank structure is proposed that is constructed using the basis vectors of discrete cosine transform. The proposed filterbank decomposes EEG signals into its respective brain rhythms: delta, theta, alpha, beta, and gamma. Second, these brain rhythms are statistically modeled with the class of self-similar Gaussian random processes, namely, fractional Brownian motion and fractional Gaussian noises. The statistics of these processes are modeled using a single parameter called the Hurst exponent. In the last stage, the value of Hurst exponent and autoregressive moving average parameters are used as features to design a binary support vector machine classifier to classify pre-ictal, inter-ictal (epileptic with seizure free interval), and ictal (seizure) EEG segments. The performance of the classifier is assessed via extensive analysis on two widely used data set and is observed to provide good accuracy on both the data set.

Pachori,A Multivariate Approach for Patient-Specific EEG Seizure Detection Using Empirical Wavelet Transform,IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering,,1558-2531,"Objective: This paper investigates the multivariate oscillatory nature of electroencephalogram (EEG) signals in adaptive frequency scales for epileptic seizure detection. Methods: The empirical wavelet transform (EWT) has been explored for the multivariate signals in order to determine the joint instantaneous amplitudes and frequencies in signal adaptive frequency scales. The proposed multivariate extension of EWT has been studied on multivariate multicomponent synthetic signal, as well as on multivariate EEG signals of Children's Hospital Boston-Massachusetts Institute of Technology (CHB-MIT) scalp EEG database. In a moving-window-based analysis, 2-s-duration multivariate EEG signal epochs containing five automatically selected channels have been decomposed and three features have been extracted from each 1-s part of the 2-s-duration joint instantaneous amplitudes of multivariate EEG signals. The extracted features from each oscillatory level have been processed using a proposed feature processing step and joint features have been computed in order to achieve better discrimination of seizure and seizure-free EEG signal epochs. Results: The proposed detection method has been evaluated over 177 h of EEG records using six classifiers. We have achieved average sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy values as 97.91%, 99.57%, and 99.41%, respectively, using tenfold cross-validation method, which are higher than the compared state of art methods studied on this database.

Misdiagnosis of epileptic seizures is a common problem. Therefore, an automatic seizure detection algorithm can help neurologists in diagnosing epilepsy correctly in lesser time with higher accuracy. In this paper, we have proposed an automated seizure detection algorithm based on continuous wavelet transform (CWT) and convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Seizure and non-seizure events are classified from the University of Bonn Germany dataset. To train the Deep learning-based classifier efficiently, the amount of data is increased using a data augmentation technique. After that, the data is window segmented and continuous wavelet transform (CWT) is employed on these segments to get a scalogram plot. The image of the scalogram plot is used in training the CNN model for seizure classification.

Ozturk,Epileptic Seizure Classification for Each of Five Classes Using Time-Domain and Wavelet Decomposition Based Features,2021 Medical Technologies Congress (TIPTEKNO),2687-7783,,"With the rapid developments in medical technologies and computers, it is getting easier to detect neurological disorders. However, the early detection of Epilepsy which is a common and important neurological disorder is still a crucial and challenging procedure. Like the other disorders, early detection gives some chances for controlling and smoothing of the effects of the disease. Developing early detection methods for epileptic seizures from Electroencephalography (EEG) signals using signal processing and machine learning techniques has been a popular research area in last decades. In this work, we propose to use some time-domain features together with same features extracted for sub-signals of the original signal. For obtaining sub-signals from EEG signal, we used classical discrete-time wavelet decomposition. All EEG signals have been decomposed to five important sub-bands. After extracting features from EEG signals and all sub-signals, we have applied the feature matrices to some machine learning algorithms. Most of the researches in this area distinguish only two or three states of epileptic seizures. In contrary to majority, we preferred to classify all five classes from EEG signals. Classification results of our method show an important success comparing with the other researches. Using statistical, auto-correlation based and wavelet transform based features of EEG signals together to predict and detect epilepsy makes our method robust. In this work, we present the comparison of machine learning techniques for the detection of epilepsy using electroencephalography (EEG) signals. The five states of epilepsy are classified using Naive Bayes (NB), Decision Tree (DT), Random Forest (RF), Multilayer Perceptrons (MLP), k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN), and Support Vector Machines (SVM) algorithms.

Sci.,03029743 (ISSN); 978-331969181-7 (ISBN),,"Brain signals refer to electroencephalogram (EEG) data that contain the most important information in the human brain, which are non-stationary and nonlinear in nature. EEG signals are a mixture of sustained oscillation and non-oscillatory transients that are difficult to deal with by linear methods. This paper proposes a new technique based on a tunable Q-factor wavelet transform (TQWT) and statistical method (SM), denoted as TQWT-SM, to analyze epileptic EEG recordings. Firstly, EEG signals are decomposed into different sub—bands by the TWQT method, which is parameterized by its Q-factor and redundancy. This approach depends on the resonance of signals, instead of frequency or scales as the Fourier and wavelet transforms do. Secondly, each type of the sub-band vector is divided into n windows, and 10 statistical features from each window are extracted. Finally all the obtained statistical features are forwarded to a k nearest neighbor (k-NN) classifier to evaluate the performance of the proposed TQWT-SM method. The TQWT-SM features extraction method achieves good experimental results for the seven different epileptic EEG binary-categories by the k-NN classifier, in terms of accuracy (Acc), Matthew’s correlation coefficient (MCC), and F score (F1). The outcomes of the proposed technique can assist the experts to detect epileptic seizures. © 2017, Springer International Publishing AG.",https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-69182-4_6,10.1007/978-3-319-69182-4_6,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85032505156&doi=10.1007%2f978-3-319-69182-4_6&partnerID=40&md5=aa7c6b12ab8589640fb1ce2622db569a,2017,28/03/2024 1:15,28/03/2024 1:15,,45-55,,,10594 LNCS,,,,,,,,Springer Verlag,,English,,,Scopus,,,,,"<p>ASReview_relevant</p>; <p>Export Date: 13 February 2024; Cited By: 7; Correspondence Address: H.R.

Features are not only the most important, but also the most difficult task from the classification process as they define input data and classification quality. An ideal set of features would make the classification problem trivial. This article presents novel methods of feature extraction processing and automatic epilepsy seizure classification combining machine learning methods with genetic evolution algorithms. Methods: Classification is performed on EEG data that represent electric brain activity. At first, the signal is preprocessed with digital filtration and adaptive segmentation using fractal dimensions as the only segmentation measure. In the next step, a novel method using genetic programming (GP) combined with support vector machine (SVM) confusion matrix as fitness function weight is used to extract feature vectors compressed into lower dimension space and classify the final result into ictal or interictal epochs. Results: The final application of GP–SVM method improves the discriminatory performance of a classifier by reducing feature dimensionality at the same time. Members of the GP tree structure represent the features themselves and their number is automatically decided by the compression function introduced in this paper. This novel method improves the overall performance of the SVM classification by dramatically reducing the size of input feature vector. Conclusion: According to results, the accuracy of this algorithm is very high and comparable, or even superior to other automatic detection algorithms. In combination with the great efficiency, this algorithm can be used in real-time epilepsy detection applications. From the results of the algorithm’s classification, we can observe high sensitivity, specificity results, except for the Generalized Tonic Clonic Seizure (GTCS). As the next step, the optimization of the compression stage and final SVM evaluation stage is in place. More data need to be obtained on GTCS to improve the overall classification score for GTCS. © 2018 Jirka et al.",https://doi.org/10.2147/NDT.S167841,10.2147/NDT.S167841,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85057527753&doi=10.2147%2fNDT.S167841&partnerID=40&md5=ad0efb4490d62d73d6c57ded0a1f0599,2018,28/03/2024 1:15,28/03/2024 1:15,,2439-2449,,,14,,Neuropsychiatr.

Second, two methods of frequency space transformation were used such as Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT), separating signal into sub-bands and Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD) technique to decompose signal into the Intrinsic Mode Functions (IMFs).

This paper proposes to employ the logarithmic normalized functional singular values as the features for performing the classification of both the two class problem (normal and seizure set) and the three class problem (normal, seizure free and seizure set). Here, the EEGs are taken from two well known datasets. First, each EEG is decomposed via the singular spectrum analysis (SSA) to obtain the singular values. Then, the logarithmic normalized functional values of these singular values are calculated to form the feature vectors for performing the classification of the epileptic seizure. Next, different classifiers including the support vector machine (SVM), the k nearest neighbor classifier, the extreme learning machine (ELM) and the artificial neural network (ANN) are employed for performing the classification. Finally, a ten fold cross validation procedure is employed to ensure the reliability and the stability of the classifiers. The computer numerical simulation results show that the k nearest neighbor classifier achieves the best performance compared to other classifiers for performing both the two class epileptic classification and the three class epileptic classification. Our proposed method also achieves the higher classification accuracies compared to the case without performing the logarithmic normalized operation. Moreover, the performance of our proposed method is evaluated on the original EEGs under the white noise environment at different signal to noise ratios.

594,CFX7EPGI,journalArticle,2021,"Shariat, A.; Zarei, A.; Karvigh, S.A.; Asl, B.M.",Automatic detection of epileptic seizures using Riemannian geometry from scalp EEG recordings,Medical and Biological Engineering and Computing,,01400118 (ISSN),"This paper proposes a new framework for epileptic seizure detection using non-invasive scalp electroencephalogram (sEEG) signals. The major innovation of the current study is using the Riemannian geometry for transforming the covariance matrices estimated from the EEG channels into a feature vector. The spatial covariance matrices are considered as features in order to extract the spatial information of the sEEG signals without applying any spatial filtering. Since these matrices are symmetric and positive definite (SPD), they belong to a special manifold called the Riemannian manifold. Furthermore, a kernel based on Riemannian geometry is proposed. This kernel maps the SPD matrices onto the Riemannian tangent space. The SPD matrices, obtained from all channels of the segmented sEEG signals, have high dimensions and extra information. For these reasons, the sequential forward feature selection method is applied to select the best features and reduce the computational burden in the classification step. The selected features are fed into a support vector machine (SVM) with an RBF kernel to classify the feature vectors into seizure and non-seizure classes. The performance of the proposed method is evaluated using two long-term scalp EEG (CHB-MIT benchmark and private) databases. Experimental results on all 23 subjects of the CHB-MIT database reveal an accuracy of 99.87%, a sensitivity of 99.91%, and a specificity of 99.82%. In addition, the introduced algorithm is tested on the private sEEG signals recorded from 20 patients, having 1380 seizures. The proposed approach achieves an accuracy, a sensitivity, and a specificity of 98.14%, 98.16%, and 98.12%, respectively. The experimental results on both sEEG databases demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method for automated epileptic seizure detection, especially for the private database which has noisier signals in comparison to the CHB-MIT database.

Electroencephalogram based automatic epileptic seizure detection has significant applications in epilepsy treatment and medical diagnosis. In this study, a novel epileptic seizure detection method is proposed with a combination of empirical mode decomposition, mutual information-based best individual feature (MIBIF) selection algorithm and multi-layer perceptron neural network. Initially, fixed length EEG epochs are decomposed into amplitude and frequency-modulated components called intrinsic mode functions (IMFs). Three features named ellipse area of second-order difference plot, variance and fluctuation index are calculated from first few IMFs. The most significant features are then selected from the calculated features using the MIBIF algorithm to produce a final feature set. Later, the generated feature set is fed into the multi-layer perceptron neural network (MLPNN) classifier.

Firstly, the wavelet decomposition is executed to the original EEGs with five scales, the scale 3, 4 and 5 are selected and transformed into histograms and afterwards the distances between histograms in pairs are computed applying the earth mover’s distance as effective features. Then, the EMD features are sent to the classifier based on the Bayesian linear discriminant analysis (BLDA) for classification, and an efficient postprocessing procedure is applied to improve the detection system precision, finally.

This methodology can be divided into subsequent stages of channel selection, feature extraction, feature selection, and prediction phase. The channel selection was implemented by employing the Boruta algorithm. The best performing channels were chosen. In feature extraction we investigated three fundamental roads: extracting statistical features from the raw EEG signals (mean variance, mean skewness, and mean kurtosis), performing empirical mode decomposition on raw EEG data to generate intrinsic mode functions and extracting statistical features from the generated intrinsic mode functions, and calculating the power spectral density of all channels partitioned into five frequency bands. These extracted features were then tested for their efficacy using the Boruta algorithm, resulting in the most desirable ones being selected. At last, in the prediction phase, the resultant dataset is tried on different machine learning classifiers: support vector machines (SVM), random forest, K-nearest neighbors (KNN), and LSTM.

It is a long process, is error prone, and requires a highly trained expert. In this research, a new method is presented for seizure classification for EEG signals using a dual-tree complex wavelet transform (DT-CWT) and fast Fourier transform (FFT) coupled with a least square support vector machine (LS-SVM) classifier. In this method, each EEG signal is divided into four segments. Each segment is further split into smaller sub-segments. The DT-CWT is applied to decompose each sub-segment into detailed and approximation coefficients (real and imaginary parts). The obtained coefficients by the DT-CWT at each decomposition level are passed through an FFT to identify the relevant frequency bands. Finally, a set of effective features are extracted from the sub-segments, and are then forwarded to the LS-SVM classifier to classify epileptic EEGs. In this paper, two epileptic EEG databases from Bonn and Bern Universities are used to evaluate the extracted features using the proposed method. The experimental results demonstrate that the method obtained an average accuracy of 97.7% and 96.8% for the Bonn and Bern databases, respectively. The results prove that the proposed DT-CWT and FFT based features extraction is an effective way to extract discriminative information from brain signals. The obtained results are also compared to those by k-means and Naïve Bayes classifiers as well as with the results from the previous methods reported for classifying epileptic seizures and identifying the focal and non-focal EEG signals. The obtained results show that the proposed method outperforms the others and it is effective in detecting epileptic seziures in EEG signals. The technique can be adopted to aid neurologists to better diagnose neurological disorders and for an early seizure warning system. © 2022",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.brainres.2022.147777,10.1016/j.brainres.2022.147777,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85123712411&doi=10.1016%2fj.brainres.2022.147777&partnerID=40&md5=f26c1a881ee4d8d8fc302c88eec063a3,2022,28/03/2024 1:15,28/03/2024 1:15,,,,,1779,,Brain Res.,,,,,,,,English,,,Scopus,,,,,"<p>ASReview_relevant</p>; <p>Export Date: 13 February 2024; Cited By: 12; Correspondence Address: W.

In this study, 1D-LBP, which utilizes all data points, was employed for extracting features in raw EEG signals, Fisher score (FS) was employed to select the representative features, which can also be determined as hidden patterns. Additionally, GRA is performed to classify EEG signals through these Fisher scored features. The experimental results of the proposed approach, which was employed in a public dataset for validation, showed that it has a high accuracy in identifying epileptic EEG signals.

Notes Comput. Sci.,03029743 (ISSN); 978-331942296-1 (ISBN),,"Automatic detection of epileptic seizure plays an important role in the diagnosis of epilepsy for it can obtain invisible information of epileptic electroencephalogram (EEG) signals exactly and reduce the heavy burdens of doctors efficiently. Current automatic detection technologies are almost shallow learning models that are insufficient to learn the complex and non-stationary epileptic EEG signals. Moreover, most of their feature extraction or feature selection methods are supervised and depend on domain-specific expertise. To solve these problems, we proposed a novel framework for the automatic detection of epileptic EEG by using stacked sparse autoencoder (SSAE) with a softmax classifier. The proposed framework firstly learns the sparse and high level representations from the preprocessed data via SSAE, and then send these representations into softmax classifier for training and classification. To verify the performance of this framework, we adopted the epileptic EEG datasets to conduct experiments. The simulation results with an average accuracy of 96% illustrated the effectiveness of the proposed framework. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.",https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-42297-8_74,10.1007/978-3-319-42297-8_74,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84978880611&doi=10.1007%2f978-3-319-42297-8_74&partnerID=40&md5=ad3b388c09f1d346b4c7e07a02134c44,2016,28/03/2024 1:15,28/03/2024 1:15,,802-810,,,9773,,,,,,,,Springer Verlag,,English,,,Scopus,,,,,"<p>ASReview_relevant</p>; <p>Export Date: 13 February 2024; Cited By: 60; Correspondence Address: Y.

Electroencephalogram (EEG) is a common clinical method to detect epilepsy seizure from EEG signals. Several automated techniques have been proposed for classifying different classes of epilepsy report satisfactory results, but still there is room available for improving the classification accuracy. The proposed work uses a new artificial neural network (ANN)-based algorithm with adaptive momentum that can improve the classification accuracy of the classifier. Backpropagation with variable adaptive momentum (BPVAM) achieves high diagnostic accuracy and has high stability and robustness against data variations. The algorithm has also shown the ability to achieve the results in a highly efficient time compared to other well-known techniques. In addition, principal component analysis (PCA) has widely been used as a feature extraction method. Therefore, these two methods have been combined to form a robust classifier known as BPVAM-PCA that can improve the classification accuracy. To illustrate the ability of the proposed method, several experiments were performed for epilepsy cases identification from EEG signals.

Bhatia,Detection of Epileptic Seizures using EEG Signals,2020 International Conference on Artificial Intelligence and Signal Processing (AISP),2640-5768,,"Epilepsy is a neurological disorder which causes abnormal brain activity such as seizures. Electroencephalogram (EEG) signals are recordings of the electrical activity of brain, which are used extensively in many medical applications, including detection of epileptic seizures. Traditionally, neurologists made inferences by visual inspection. However, this was usually very time consuming and the results are subject to the expertise of the reader. Hence, automatic epileptic seizure detection techniques are needed, which are able to provide high quality results in a short time. In this paper, an approach has been proposed that uses Discrete Wavelet Transform to convert the EEG signal into the time-frequency domain. Approximation and detail coefficients were obtained after the discrete wavelet transform of EEG signals. Then, various features are extracted and then classification is carried out on a number of classifiers including convolutional neural networks, random forests etc for the detection of epilepsy seizure. Results show that our processing technique and the combination of features extracted provide far superior results than those obtained by applying the classifiers on the EEG signals directly. In our work, an accuracy of 99.29 was achieved which outperformed the conventional epileptic seizure detection techniques.

Automatic seizure detection can help improve a patient's interaction with her/his environment, and while many approaches have been proposed the problem is still not trivially solved. Methods: In this work, we present a novel methodology for feature extraction on EEG signals that allows us to perform a highly accurate classification of epileptic states. Specifically, Hölderian regularity and the Matching Pursuit algorithm are used as the main feature extraction techniques, and are combined with basic statistical features to construct the final feature sets. These sets are then delivered to a Random Forests classification algorithm to differentiate between epileptic and non-epileptic readings. Results: Several versions of the basic problem are tested and statistically validated producing perfect accuracy in most problems and 97.6% accuracy on the most difficult case. Comparison with existing methods: A comparison with recent literature, using a well known database, reveals that our proposal achieves state-of-the-art performance. Conclusions: The experimental results show that epileptic states can be accurately detected by combining features extracted through regularity analysis, the Matching Pursuit algorithm and simple time-domain statistical analysis.

The epilepsy is unpredictable and recurrent, so it is very difficult to treat. In this paper, we propose a new Electroencephalography (EEG) seizure detection method by using the dual-tree complex wavelet (DTCWT) - Fourier features. These features achieve perfect classification rates (100%) for the EEG database from the University of Bonn. These classification rates outperform a number of existing EEG seizure detection methods published in the literature. However, it should be mentioned that several recent works also achieved this perfect classification rate (100%). Our proposed method should be as good as these works since our method only performs the DTCWT transform for up to 5 scales and our method only conducts the FFT to the 4th and 5th scales of the DTCWT decomposition. In addition, we could replace the conventional FFT in our method by sparse FFT so that our method could be even faster. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Hence, careful analysis of these signals could be useful in understanding many human brain disorder diseases. One such disease topic is epileptic seizure identification, which can be identified via a classification process of the EEG signal after preprocessing with the discrete wavelet transform (DWT). To classify the EEG signal, we used a radial basis function neural network (RBFNN). As shown herein, the network can be trained to optimize the mean square error (MSE) by using a modified particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm. The key idea behind the modification of PSO is to introduce a method to overcome the problem of slow searching in and around the global optimum solution. The effectiveness of this procedure was verified by an experimental analysis on a benchmark dataset which is publicly available. The result of our experimental analysis revealed that the improvement in the algorithm is significant with respect to RBF trained by gradient descent and canonical PSO. Here, two classes of EEG signals were considered: the first being an epileptic and the other being non-epileptic.

Zheng,A boosted cascade for efficient epileptic seizure detection,2013 35th Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society (EMBC),1558-4615,,"Seizure detection from electroencephalogram (EEG) plays an important role for epilepsy therapy. Due to the diversity of seizure EEG patterns between different individuals, multiple features are necessary for high accuracy since a single feature could hardly encode all types of epileptiform discharges. However, a large feature set inevitably causes the increase of the computational cost. This paper proposes a boosted cascade chain to obtain both high detection performance and high computational efficiency. Sixteen features that are widely used in seizure detection are implemented. Considering the sequential characteristics of EEG signals, the features are extracted on each 1-second segment and its former three segments. Thus, a total of 64 features are used to construct a feature pool. Based on the feature pool, Real AdaBoost is used to select a group of effective features, on which weak classifiers are learned to assemble a strong classifier. The strong classifier is transformed to a cascade classifier by reordering the weak classifiers and learning a threshold for each weak classifier. The cascade classifier still has the similar classification strength to the original strong classifier. More importantly, it is able to reject easy non-seizure samples by the first a few weak classifiers in the cascade, thus high computational efficiency can be obtained. To evaluate our method, 90.6-hour EEG signals from four patients are tested. The experimental results show that our method can achieve an average accuracy of 95.31% and an average detection rate of 91.29% with the false positive rate of 4.68%. On average, only about 4 features are used.

Characterised by sudden bursts of excess electricity in the brain, manifesting as seizures, epilepsy is still not well understood when compared with other neurological disorders. Seizures often happen unexpectedly and attempting to predict them has been a research topic for the last 30 years. Electroencephalograms have been integral to these studies, as the recordings that they produce can capture the brain's electrical signals. The diagnosis of epilepsy is usually made by a neurologist, but can be difficult to make in the early stages. Supporting para-clinical evidence obtained from magnetic resonance imaging and electroencephalography may enable clinicians to make a diagnosis of epilepsy and instigate treatment earlier. However, electroencephalogram capture and interpretation is time consuming and can be expensive due to the need for trained specialists to perform the interpretation. Automated detection of correlates of seizure activity generalised across different regions of the brain and across multiple subjects may be a solution. This paper explores this idea further and presents a supervised machine learning approach that classifies seizure and non-seizure records using an open dataset containing 342 records (171 seizures and 171 non-seizures). Our approach posits a new method for generalising seizure detection across different subjects without prior knowledge about the focal point of seizures. Our results show an improvement on existing studies with 88% for sensitivity, 88% for specificity and 93% for the area under the curve, with a 12% global error, using the k-NN classifier. © 2015 The Authors",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.aci.2015.01.001,10.1016/j.aci.2015.01.001,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85047863443&doi=10.1016%2fj.aci.2015.01.001&partnerID=40&md5=fe61b061d60e4f89e989daa2aa354539,2016,28/03/2024 1:15,28/03/2024 1:15,,70-89,,1,12,,Appl.

Limited availability of seizure Electroencephalogram (EEG) data makes the application of machine learning techniques for epileptic seizure detection very challenging. In this work, an efficient algorithmic procedure is proposed to facilitate the learning and classification of epileptic seizures from imbalanced EEG data. We designed an end-to-end architecture by combining local binary pattern with Siamese convolutional neural network. We used local binary pattern due to its capability to capture distinguishable morphological characteristics in the EEG signal. Siamese convolutional neural network was used since it can learn a similarity metric using an extremely small number of training samples for seizure episodes. With availability of a very small amount of training (seizure) samples, the effectiveness of the proposed method was verified by comparing the Siamese convolutional neural network with a baseline convolutional neural network.

The LMD is employed to decompose the EEG signals into a set of product functions, and the first three product functions are selected to extract three features to characterize the behavior of EEG recordings. After that, the DPL model can learn a synthesis dictionary and an analysis dictionary from the training samples, and then encode the test samples over the learned dictionary.

However, most researchers have implemented seizure detectors by manually hand-engineering features from observed EEG data, and used them in seizure detection, which might not scale well to new patterns of seizures. In this paper, we investigate the possibility of utilising unsupervised feature learning, the recent development of deep learning, to automatically learn features from raw, unlabelled EEG data that are representative enough to be used in seizure detection. We develop patient-specific seizure detectors by using stacked autoencoders and logistic classifiers. A two-step training consisting of the greedy layer-wise and the global fine-tuning was used to train our detectors.

The accurate and rapid detection of seizures not only reflects the efficiency of the algorithm, but also greatly reduces the burden of manual detection during long-term electroencephalogram (EEG) recording. In this work, a stacked one-dimensional convolutional neural network (1D-CNN) model combined with a random selection and data augmentation (RS-DA) strategy is proposed for seizure onset detection. Firstly, we segmented the long-term EEG signals using 2-s sliding windows. Then, the 2-s interictal and ictal segments were classified by the stacked 1D-CNN model. During model training, a RS-DA strategy was applied to solve the problem of sample imbalance, and the patient-specific model was trained with event-based K-fold (K is the number of seizures per patient) cross validation for detecting all seizures of each patient. Finally, we evaluated the performances of the proposed approach in the two levels: the segment-based level and the event-based level. The proposed method was tested on two long-term EEG datasets: the CHB-MIT sEEG dataset and the SWEC-ETHZ iEEG dataset. For the CHB-MIT sEEG dataset, we achieved 88.14% sensitivity, 99.62% specificity and 99.54% accuracy in the segment-based level. From the perspective of the event-based level, 99.31% sensitivity, 0.2/h false detection rate (FDR) and mean 8.1-s latency were achieved. For the SWEC-ETHZ iEEG dataset, in the segment-based level, 90.09% sensitivity, 99.81% specificity and 99.73% accuracy were obtained. In the event-based level, 97.52% sensitivity, 0.07/h FDR and mean 13.2-s latency were attained. From these results, we can see that our method can effectively use both sEEG and iEEG data to detect epileptic seizures, and this may provide a reference for the clinical application of seizure onset detection. © 2021 The Authors",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neucom.2021.06.048,10.1016/j.neucom.2021.06.048,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85110198603&doi=10.1016%2fj.neucom.2021.06.048&partnerID=40&md5=8d1a771029da66ffd26fe6abe455e210,2021,28/03/2024 1:15,28/03/2024 1:15,,212-222,,,459,,Neurocomputing,,,,,,,,English,,,Scopus,,,,,"<p>ASReview_relevant</p>; <p>Export Date: 13 February 2024; Cited By: 44; Correspondence Address: T.

The word EEG refers to a signal from the head that is obtained from the brain. The neuronal bombardment in the brain causes it. The EEG signal provides useful information on brain function and neurobiological illnesses, as it provides visual indications of the recorded waveform and enables approaches for computer-supporting signal processing to be characterized.

In this study, a novel hybrid deep learning and SVM technique is employed on a restructured EEG data. EEG signals were transformed into a two-dimensional image sequence. Clough-Tocher technique is employed for interpolation of the values obtained from the electrodes placed on the skull during EEG measurements in order to estimate the signal strength in the missing places over the picture. After the parameters in the deep learning architecture were optimized on the validation data, it is observed that the proposed technique's performance for classifying epilepsy moments over EEG signals demonstrated unmatched performance.

The manual inspection of epileptic seizures is a time-consuming and laborious process. Extensive automatic detection algorithms were proposed by using traditional approaches, which show good accuracy for several specific EEG classification problems but perform poorly in others. To address this issue, the authors present a novel model, named SeizureNet, for robust detection of epileptic seizures using EEG signals based on convolutional neural network. Firstly, they utilise two convolutional neural networks to extract time-invariant features from single-channel EEG signals. Then, a fully connected layer is employed to learn high-level features.

In this age of the internet of things, the smart diagnosis of epilepsy has gained huge research attention with machine learning-based seizure detection in cloud-fog assisted environments. The present paper also proposes a cloud-fog integrated smart neurocare approach, which performs a temporal analysis of raw electroencephalogram (EEG) signals using deep learning to detect the occurrence of epileptic seizures. This patient-independent approach makes use of single-channel EEG signals to achieve real-time and computationally efficient seizure detection at fog layer devices. It employs a maximum variance-based channel selection procedure to select only one channel of raw scalp EEG signals, followed by their filtering and segmentation into various short-duration temporal segments. To analyse EEG patterns, these segments are further fed to the proposed models of convolutional neural network, recurrent neural network and stacked autoencoder deep learning classifiers. The performance analysis through simulation results evidently reveals that the proposed convolutional neural network-based temporal analysis approach performs better than other approaches. It realises an optimum accuracy of 96.43%, sensitivity of 100% and specificity of 93.33% for 30s duration EEG segments of CHB-MIT dataset and achieves 100% accuracy, sensitivity and specificity values for EEG segments of Bonn dataset for 23.6s EEG segments. Thus, the proposed convolutional neural network-based approach emerges as an appropriate method for rapid and accurate detection of epileptic seizures in fog-cloud integrated environment. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s11042-022-12512-z,10.1007/s11042-022-12512-z,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85127587055&doi=10.1007%2fs11042-022-12512-z&partnerID=40&md5=06e7d1c08478ca55d4ee4cc1008887fe,2022,28/03/2024 1:15,28/03/2024 1:15,,29555-29586,,20,81,,Multimedia Tools Appl,,,,,,,,English,,,Scopus,,,,,"<p>ASReview_relevant</p>; <p>Export Date: 13 February 2024; Cited By: 19; Correspondence Address: K.

The manual analysis of EEG must be conducted by highly trained clinicians or neuro-physiologists; a process that is considered to have a comparatively low inter-rater agreement. Furthermore, the new data interpretation consumes an excessive amount of time and resources. Hence, an automatic seizure detection and prediction system can improve the quality of patient care in terms of shortening the diagnosis period, reducing manual errors, and automatically detecting debilitating events. Moreover, for patient treatment, it is important to alert the patients of epilepsy seizures prior to seizure occurrence. Various distinguished studies presented good solutions for two-class seizure detection problems with binary classification scenarios. To deal with these challenges, this paper puts forward effective approaches for EEG signal classification for normal, pre-ictal, and ictal activities. Three models are presented for the classification task. Two of them are patient-specific, while the third one is patient non-specific, which makes it better for the general classification tasks. The two-class classification is implemented between normal and pre-ictal activities for seizure prediction and between normal and ictal activities for seizure detection. A more generalized three-class classification framework is considered to identify all EEG signal activities. The first model depends on a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with residual blocks. It contains thirteen layers with four residual learning blocks. It works on spectrograms of EEG signal segments. The second model depends on a CNN with three layers. It also works on spectrograms. On the other hand, the third model depends on Phase Space Reconstruction (PSR) to eliminate the limitations of the spectrograms used in the first models. A five-layer CNN is used with this strategy. The advantage of the PSR is the direct projection from the time domain, which keeps the main trend of different signal activities. The third model deals with all signal activities, and it was tested for all patients of the CHB-MIT dataset. It has a superior performance compared to the first models and the state-of-the-art models. © 2022 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",https://doi.org/10.1002/cnm.3573,10.1002/cnm.3573,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85129799816&doi=10.1002%2fcnm.3573&partnerID=40&md5=3f410b1327b17f02958f5a0b4788d1aa,2022,28/03/2024 1:15,28/03/2024 1:15,,,,6,38,,Int.

This paper proposes an algorithm for seizure detection using lacunarity and Bayesian linear discriminant analysis (BLDA) in long-term intracranial EEG. Lacunarity is a measure of heterogeneity for a fractal. The proposed method first conducts wavelet decomposition on EEGs with five scales, and selects the wavelet coefficients at scale 3, 4, and 5 for subsequent processing. Effective features including lacunarity and fluctuation index are extracted from the selected three scales, and then sent into the BLDA for training and classification. Finally, postprocessing which includes smoothing, threshold judgment, multichannels integration, and collar technique is applied to obtain high sensitivity and low false detection rate. The proposed algorithm is evaluated on 289.14 h intracranial EEG data from 21-patient Freiburg dataset and yields a sensitivity of 96.25% and a false detection rate of 0.13/h with a mean delay time of 13.8 s.",https://doi.org/10.1109/TBME.2013.2254486,10.1109/TBME.2013.2254486,,2013-12,28/03/2024 1:15,28/03/2024 1:15,,3375-3381,,12,60,,IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,<p>ASReview_relevant</p>,,,wavelet transform; Electroencephalography; Training; Feature extraction; seizure detection; Discrete wavelet transforms; Indexes; Fractals; Bayes methods; Bayesian linear discriminant analysis (BLDA); lacunarity,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Yes,,,,Include,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epilepsy is a central nervous system illness in which people have repeated seizures that happen at random times and usually without warning. Seizures are more likely to cause physical harm and even death in people who have them frequently. Intelligent techniques supporting brain-computer interfaces in seizure control can provide efficient epilepsy detection where seizure events can be identified in the early stages triggering electrical stimulations to be sent to the cortex of the brain. In this paper, a non-patient-specific seizure detection model is introduced. The proposed model integrates wavelet-based electroencephalography EEG brain signal processing with feature extraction to extract combined features from both time and frequency domains. Classification has been applied using different machine learning techniques for efficient early detection of epileptic seizures. In addition, channel selection analysis is implemented to reach an accurate generic model. The experimental comparative study demonstrated that the electroencephalography signals from the frontal lobe channels supply more discriminative features than the other channels, which enhanced the classification accuracy and sensitivity in the proposed model. Experiments have been carried out on the Children's Hospital Boston-Massachusetts Institute of Technology dataset to validate the robustness of the proposed model. The experimental results showed that the proposed model achieved 99.792% accuracy and 99.59% sensitivity in detecting epileptic seizures with improvement in accuracy with rates of 7%, 5%, and 8% compared to [14], [11], and [9], respectively.

Out of these epilepsy is the most prevalent neurological disorder in the human after stroke. Electroencephalogram (EEG) contains valuable information related to different physiological state of the brain. A scheme is presented for detecting epileptic seizures from EEG data recorded from normal subjects and epileptic patients. The scheme is based on discrete wavelet transform (DWT) analysis and approximate entropy (ApEn) of EEG signals. Seizure detection is performed in two stages. In the first stage, EEG signals are decomposed by DWT to calculate approximation and detail coefficients. In the second stage, ApEn values of the approximation and detail coefficients are calculated. Significant differences have been found between the ApEn values of the epileptic and the normal EEG allowing us to detect seizures with 100 % classification accuracy using artificial neural network. The analysis results depicted that during seizure activity, EEG had lower ApEn values compared to normal EEG. This gives that epileptic EEG is more predictable or less complex than the normal EEG.

The present work focuses on developing an efficient epileptic seizure detection system using intracranial EEG signals. Dual tree complex wavelet transform is used to decompose the signal into various sub-frequency bands. Probability features are used to extract efficient indicators for seizure and healthy classes. Discriminant correlation analysis is used to increase the difference between different classes as well as reduce the difference between same classes. The fused feature set is clustered using fuzzy c means clustering algorithm. Hidden Markov model discriminates the seizure class with healthy class with good efficiency.

These abnormal electrical activities can be recorded via multi-channel electroencephalography (EEG) signals placed on the scalp of the brain. Usually, these signals, recorded from this EEG device, are interpreted by the neurologist which require their availability and it is very time consuming especially for long duration signals. This study presents a fully automatic system for the detection of seizure from non-seizure signals. Firstly, it pre-processes the signal to remove noise and artefacts from the raw-EEG signals and then extracts features. Features are extracted from time-domain, spectral domain, wavelet domain. In addition, connectivity and entropy based feature have also been extracted. After that, prominent features have been selected from this large feature set by a multi-objective evolutionary algorithm and finally, Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier has been used for classification. A Bayesian optimization algorithm has been used to optimize the hyper-parameters of SVM. Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) and Quadratic Linear Discriminant Analysis (QLDA) have also been used for comparison.

Electroencephalograms (EEGs) record neural activity and can detect epilepsy. Visual inspection of an EEG signal for epileptic seizure detection is a time-consuming process and may lead to human error; therefore, recently, a number of automated seizure detection frameworks were proposed to replace these traditional methods. Feature extraction and classification are two important steps in these procedures. Feature extraction focuses on finding the informative features that could be used for classification and correct decision-making. Therefore, proposing effective feature extraction techniques for seizure detection is of great significance. METHODS: Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is a dimensionality reduction technique used in different fields of pattern recognition including EEG signal classification. Global modular PCA (GModPCA) is a variation of PCA. In this paper, an effective framework with GModPCA and Support Vector Machine (SVM) is presented for epileptic seizure detection in EEG signals. The feature extraction is performed with GModPCA, whereas SVM trained with radial basis function kernel performed the classification between seizure and nonseizure EEG signals. Seven different experimental cases were conducted on the benchmark epilepsy EEG dataset. The system performance was evaluated using 10-fold cross-validation. In addition, we prove analytically that GModPCA has less time and space complexities as compared to PCA. RESULTS: The experimental results show that EEG signals have strong inter-sub-pattern correlations. GModPCA and SVM have been able to achieve 100% accuracy for the classification between normal and epileptic signals. Along with this, seven different experimental cases were tested. The classification results of the proposed approach were better than were compared the results of some of the existing methods proposed in literature. It is also found that the time and space complexities of GModPCA are less as compared to PCA. CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that GModPCA and SVM could be used for automated epileptic seizure detection in EEG signal. © 2017-IOS Press and the authors.

It is certainly a very heavy burden to only recognize EEG epilepsy manually, so the method of computer-assisted treatment is of great importance. This paper presents a seizure detection algorithm based on variational modal decomposition (VMD) and a deep forest (DF) model. Variational modal decomposition is performed on EEG recordings, and the first three variational modal functions (VMFs) are selected to construct the time–frequency distribution of the EEG signals. Then, the log−Euclidean covariance matrix (LECM) is computed to represent the EEG properties and form EEG features. The deep forest model is applied to complete the EEG signal classification, which is a non-neural network deep model with a cascade structure that performs feature learning through the forest. In addition, to improve the classification accuracy, postprocessing techniques are performed to generate the discriminant results by moving average filtering and adaptive collar expansion. The algorithm was evaluated on the Bonn EEG dataset and the Freiburg long−term EEG dataset, and the former achieved a sensitivity and specificity of 99.32% and 99.31%, respectively. The mean sensitivity and specificity of this method for the 21 patients in the Freiburg dataset were 95.2% and 98.56%, respectively, with a false detection rate of 0.36/h.

Generally, epilepsy is treated and diagnosed through continuous examination and interpretation of the electroencephalography (EEG) signals. This is a very time-consuming and tedious job. Further, it is subjected to observational errors and observer variability. Hence, the development of an efficient automatic alarm system to recognize epileptic seizure signals is of important concern. The objectives of the present study are to investigate deep learning based long short term memory (LSTM) networks for the classification of epileptic EEG signals using time-frequency analysis. Additionally, a comparative investigation is carried out to evaluate the various state-of-the-art feature selection and classification models for automatic classification of EEG signals for Epilepsy detection. Features based on statistics, entropy, and fractal were extracted from both the time domain and frequency domain. The extracted features were supplied to LSTM networks and traditional machine learning models for epileptic EEG classification. High classification accuracy of 100% (under hold out and 10-fold protocol) and 99.80% (under 10-fold protocol) is achieved by the proposed LSTM strategy followed by the Back Propagation Artificial Neural network (BPANN) which achieves 99.6% classification accuracy when all the 150 EEG biomarkers were used as input to the classifier under 10-fold cross-validation technique. Further, when the top 30 most relevant features selected by different feature selection techniques are used for classification, the proposed approach achieves similar performance followed by BPANN which reports 99.4% classification accuracy when combined with the Relief F feature selection technique. © 2022 by the authors.

Prediction of epileptic seizures before the onset is beneficial for the prevention of seizures through medication. Electroencephalograms (EEG) signals are used to predict epileptic seizures using machine learning techniques and feature extractions. Nevertheless, the pre-processing of EEG signals for noise removal and extraction of features are two significant problems that have an adverse effect on both anticipation time and true positive prediction performance. Considering this, the proposed model will provide remarkable methods for both pre-processing and extraction of features. The proposed model detects various brain states and accounts for both epileptic seizures detection and prediction. Using the EEG CHB-MIT dataset, the support vector machine (SVM) model was trained, tested, and compared, having a best true positive percentage of 91% for a single patient and 82% for multiple patients.

Any kind of problem to brain can cause great danger to whole nervous system and all together whole body. Epilepsy, disorder like parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's disease, is characterized by a rapid burst of neurochemical activity in the brain. This anomaly manifests as a seizure, and its detection is very important study issue. Electroencephalography(EEG) is one of the methods used for studying brain activity, neurological illnesses, and epileptic seizures in particular with use of Electroencephalography (EEG) Signal. Neurologists need to spend time visually inspecting epileptic abnormalities in EEG signals. This paper presented a deep learning approach for epileptic seizure classification. Data set from Bonn University is considered for the analysis. This spectral data from 128 channels is used to excite the deep learning algorithms such as CNN. We have considered Deep Learning(DL) algorithm VGG16 for the seizure classification.

This paper presents an efficient automatic seizure detection method based on Stockwell transform (S-transform) and bidirectional long short-term memory (BiLSTM) neural networks for intracranial EEG recordings. First, S-transform is applied to raw EEG segments, and the obtained matrix is grouped into time-frequency blocks as the inputs fed into BiLSTM for feature selecting and classification. Afterwards, postprocessing is adopted to improve detection performance, which includes moving average filter, threshold judgment, multichannel fusion, and collar technique. A total of 689 h intracranial EEG recordings from 20 patients are used for evaluation of the proposed system. Segment-based assessment results show that our system achieves a sensitivity of 98.09% and specificity of 98.69%. For the event-based evaluation, a sensitivity of 96.3% and a false detection rate of 0.24/h are yielded.

People with epilepsy are commonly affected by reoccurring seizures that potentially cause injury or death. Neurologists frequently use Electroencephalography (EEG) recordings to diagnose people with epilepsy. However, this can be both laborious and error-prone, as this can rely on competency and insight from undertrained neurologists. Machine learning-based methods have been recently proposed for seizure detection so that neurologists can make a quick and correct diagnosis. However, these methods often require features of the EEG signal to be extracted from data before the data can be used. Furthermore, the choice of features often requires domain knowledge about the data, and depending on the expert knowledge of the user, the selection of which features to extract can have a dramatic impact on the classifier's performance. In this paper, we propose a novel method that can autonomously extract features from deep within a convolutional neural network (CNN) and generate easy to understand rules/explanations used for the classification of seizures from EEG signals. The aim of creating rules/explanations is to explain the internal logic of our method to give the neurologist insight into the decision-making process. Thus, distilling trust.

The electroencephalogram (EEG) is a technology that measures brain motion and represents the brain's function. EEG is an effective instrument for deciphering the brain's complicated activity. The information contained in the EEG signal pertains to the electric functioning of the brain. Neurologists have typically used direct visual inspection to detect epileptogenic abnormalities. This method is time-consuming, restricted by technical artifacts, produces varying findings depending on the reader's level of experience, and is ineffective at detecting irregularities. As a result, developing automated algorithms for detecting anomalies in EEGs associated with epilepsy is critical. The construction of a novel class of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for detecting aberrant waveforms and sensors in epilepsy EEGs is described in this research. In this study, EEG signals are analyzed using a convolutional neural network (CNN). For the automatic detection of abnormal and normal EEG indications, a novel deep one-dimensional convolutional neural network (1D CNN) model is suggested in this paper.

Automatic epileptic seizure detection is important to help neurologists to interpret the electroencephalogram signal readings, particularly the signals recorded in the ictal or seizure attack, which are more crucial than those recorded in the inter-ictal (between the attacks). Time-frequency (t-f) analysis methods, wavelet transform, and linear discriminant analysis are the most common modalities used for epileptic seizure detection. The main objective of this work is to compare between ten different test cases of the EEG signal detection methods over twenty patients considering the sensitivity, specificity, and the accuracy. The analysis has been conducted in three levels: Firstly, the EEG is filtered by a discrete wavelet transform (DWT); Secondly, five features which are relative energy, fluctuation index, variance, energy and autocorrelation are calculated; and finally, these features are applied as inputs to the support vector machine (SVM) to detect the occurrence of epilepsy. Due to the trade-off between sensitivity and specificity (i.e. as a sensitivity is improved, the specificity is degraded and vice versa), a new technique which is sensitivity-specificity product is proposed in this work. Simulation results on different test cases have shown that the maximum sensitivity-specificity product occurs when only four features are included (i.e. relative energy, fluctuation index, energy, and autocorrelation) and the fifth feature (i.e. the variance) is excluded.",https://doi.org/10.1109/JEC-ECC.2017.8305789,10.1109/JEC-ECC.2017.8305789,,18/12/2017,28/03/2024 1:15,28/03/2024 1:15,,107-110,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,<p>ASReview_relevant</p>,,,Epilepsy; SVM; Seizure; Handheld computers; DWT; Detection,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"2017 Japan-Africa Conference on Electronics, Communications and Computers (JAC-ECC)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Yes,,,,Include,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Variance in types of epileptic seizures provides challenge in recognizing the pattern of seizure signals from normal ones. In this paper, we discuss the classification of seizure and non-seizure conditions in epilepsy based on bandwidth features of EEG signals. These features were extracted using Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD). This method decomposes signal into eight Intrinsic Mode Functions (IMFs) and its residue. The IMFs is then analyzed by Hilbert transform to obtain amplitude modulation bandwidth (BAM) and frequency modulation bandwidth (BFM). These features are fed as input to Support Vector Machine (SVM). We propose to combine the first four IMFs to extract bandwidth features and we implement this method on two data sets, public data set that contains signals from both extracranial and intracranial EEG, and data set OF Rumah Sakit Universitas Airlangga (RSUA) that contains signals from extracranial EEG only. The results showed that in general, the values of accuracy and specificity using combined features of first four IMFs outperformed those using features of single IMF, for all SVM kernel functions. The best accuracy and specificity on public data set were 97.3% and 98.25% respectively using RBF kernel, while the best sensitivity was gained using polynomial kernel based on only IMF1 bandwidth features by 99.0%. The experiments on RSUA data showed that the best accuracy was 96.5% and the best specificity was 99.38% when using Mexican Hat kernel based on combined features of first four IMFs, while the best sensitivity was 94% when using polynomial kernel based on only IMF1 bandwidth features.

It affects around 70 million people all over the world. Seizure detection from Electroencephalography (EEG) has achieved rapid development. However, existing methods often extract features from single channel EEG while ignoring the spatial relationship between different EEG channels. To fill this gap, a novel seizure detection model based on linear graph convolution network (LGCN) was proposed to enhance the feature embedding of raw EEG signals during seizure and non-seizure periods. Method: Pearson correlation matrix of raw EEG signals was calculated to build the input graph of the graph neural network where the coefficients of the matrix models the spatial relations in EEG signals. The last softmax layer makes the final decision (seizure vs. non-seizure). In addition, focal loss was utilized to redefine the loss function of LGCN to deal with the data imbalance problem during seizure detection. Results: Experiments are conducted on the CHB-MIT dataset. The seizure detection accuracy, specificity, sensitivity, F1 and Auc are 99.30%, 98.82%, 99.43%, 98.73% and 98.57% respectively. Conclusions: The proposed approach yields superior performance over the-state-of-the-art in seizure detection tasks on the CHB-MIT dataset. Our method works in an end-to-end manner and it does not need manually designed features. The ability to deal with imbalanced data is also attractive in real seizure detection scenarios where the duration of seizures is much shorter than the lasting time of non-seizure events. © 2021",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cmpb.2021.106277,10.1016/j.cmpb.2021.106277,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85111073162&doi=10.1016%2fj.cmpb.2021.106277&partnerID=40&md5=f1a03e25c62fc25f5b2e891195f829e6,2021,28/03/2024 1:15,28/03/2024 1:15,,,,,208,,Comput.

Yang,Automatic Diagnosis of Epileptic Seizure in Electroencephalography Signals Using Nonlinear Dynamics Features,IEEE Access,,2169-3536,"Epilepsy is one of the most common neurological disorders generally characterized by sudden and recurrent unprovoked seizures, which is commonly diagnosed through visual inspection of electroencephalography (EEG) signals. However, since EEG signals are highly complex, nonlinear and nonstationary in nature, both visual inspection and the existing computed aid detection approaches fail to capture the intrinsic dynamics of seizure events, leading to unsatisfactory detection performance. Therefore, an accurate computer-aided automatic epileptic seizure diagnosis system is valuable and urgently needed in clinical application. In this study, we propose an automatic classification method using nonlinear dynamics features and nonlinear classifiers for determining whether the EEG signals are in interictal or ictal activities, respectively. The main novelty of this paper is that investigating the performance of discernable entropy-based nonlinear dynamics features used for automatic diagnosis of an epileptic seizure. First, the discrete wavelet transform is applied to obtain de-noised and sub-band signals. Second, the nonlinear dynamics features are extracted based on information entropy theory. Subsequently, one-way analysis of variance and forward sequential feature selection technique are employed to identify the most explainable features for seizure detection. Then the selected features are fed to six different classifiers, namely, least square-support vector machine (LS-SVM), K-nearest neighbors, logistic regression, linear discriminant analysis, Naive Bayes classifier, and random forest, for automatic diagnosis of the epileptic seizure. Finally, a public EEG dataset from Bonn University, Germany, is utilized to investigate the performance of the proposed method. The experimental results show that the LS-SVM yields the optimal performance with an accuracy of 99.50%, a sensitivity of 100.00%, and a specificity of 99.40%.

Correct identification of epileptic seizures is critical in the treatment and management of patients with epileptic disorders. One in four patients present resistance against seizures episodes and are in dire need of detecting these critical events through continuous treatment in order to manage the specific disease. Epileptic seizures can be identified by reliably and accurately monitoring the patients’ neuro and muscle activities, cardiac activity, and oxygen saturation level using state-of-the-art sensing techniques including electroencephalograms (EEGs), electromyography (EMG), electrocardiograms (ECGs), and motion or audio/video recording that focuses on the human head and body. EEG analysis provides a prominent solution to distinguish between the signals associated with epileptic episodes and normal signals; therefore, this work aims to leverage on the latest EEG dataset using cutting-edge deep learning algorithms such as random neural network (RNN), convolutional neural network (CNN), extremely random tree (ERT), and residual neural network (ResNet) to classify multiple variants of epileptic seizures from non-seizures.

Extreme epileptic events are seizures, that arise suddenly and unpredictably. Usually, treatment strategies start by analyzing brain activity during the seizures revealing their type and onset mechanisms. This approach requires collecting data for a representative number of events which is only possible during the continuous EEG monitoring over several days. A big part of the further analysis is searching for seizures on these recordings. An experienced medical specialist spends hours checking the data of a single patient and needs assistance from the automative systems for seizure detection. Machine learning methods typically address this issue in a supervised fashion and exhibit a lack of generalization. The extreme value theory allows addressing this issue with the unsupervised machine learning methods of outlier detection. Here, we make the first step toward using this approach for the seizure detection. Based on our recent work, we specified the EEG features showing extreme behavior during seizures and loaded them to the one-class SVM, a popular outlier detection algorithm. Testing the proposed approach on 83 patients, we reported 77% sensitivity and 12% precision. In 60 patients, sensitivity was 100%. In the rest 23 subjects, we observed deviations from the extreme behavior. The one-class SVM used a single subject’s data for training; therefore, it was stable against between-subject variability. Our results demonstrate an effective convergence between the extreme value theory, a physical concept, and the outlier detection algorithms, a machine learning concept, toward solving the meaningful task of medicine. © 2022, The Author(s).",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-022-15675-9,10.1038/s41598-022-15675-9,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85133639099&doi=10.1038%2fs41598-022-15675-9&partnerID=40&md5=cafaf8fd8bfa0ca62b74ca52b5c55ba3,2022,28/03/2024 1:15,28/03/2024 1:15,,,,1,12,,Sci.

Electroencephalogram (EEG) is a prime tool applied for the diagnosis of epilepsy. In this study, a novel and effective approach is introduced to decompose the non-stationary EEG signals using the Fourier decomposition method. The concept of position, velocity, and acceleration has been employed on the EEG signals for feature extraction using Lp norms computed from Fourier intrinsic band functions (FIBFs). The proposed scheme comprises three main sections. In the first section, the EEG signal is decomposed into a finite number of FIBFs. In the second stage, the features are extracted from FIBFs and relevant features are selected by using the Kruskal–Wallis test. In the last stage, the significant features are passed on to the support vector machine (SVM) classifier.

The existence of a seizure showed as the characteristic of this disorder.

A standard tool used by the neurologist to diagnose epilepsy was Electroencephalogram (EEG). An automatic seizure detection in EEG signal may help them to identify the pattern of ictal condition. Since the characteristic of the EEG signal were dynamic and nonstationary, it was very challenging to interpret the signal pattern. In this study, we analyzed the use of Higuchi and Katz fractal dimension as a feature extraction method to detect an interictal and ictal state in the EEG signal. These two states were essential in the term of seizure detection and prediction system. EEG signal extracted into five frequency bands called delta, theta, alpha, beta, and gamma. Each frequency showed a different characteristic of brain-behavior in a specific condition. The extracted features then fed into a support vector machine (SVM) to classify between normal with interictal and ictal states.

Firstly, wavelet transforms are applied to EEG recordings for filtering pre-processing. Then the relative energies of signals in several particular frequency bands are calculated and inputted into Bi-GRU network. Afterwards, the outputs of Bi-GRU network are further processed by moving average filtering, threshold comparison and seizure merging to generate the discriminant results that the tested EEG belong to seizure or not.

This paper presents an EEG classification framework based on the denoising sparse autoencoder. The denoising sparse autoencoder (DSAE) is an improved unsupervised deep neural network over sparse autoencoder and denoising autoencoder, which can learn the closest representation of the data. The sparsity constraint applied in the hidden layer of the network makes the expression of data as sparse as possible so as to obtain a more efficient representation of EEG signals. In addition, corrupting operation used in input data help to enhance the robustness of the system and make it suitable for the analysis of non-stationary epileptic EEG signals. In this paper, we first imported the pre-processed training data to the DSAE network and trained the network. A logistic regression classifier was connected to the top of the DSAE. Then, put the test data into the system for classification. Finally, the output results of the overall network were post-processed to obtain the final epilepsy detection results.

These signals are frequently used to obtain information about brain neurons andmay detect disorders that affect the brain, such as epilepsy. Electroencephalogram (EEG) signals are however prone to artefacts. These artefacts must be removed to obtain accurate and meaningful signals. Currently, computer-aided systems have been used for this purpose. These systems provide high computing power, problem-specific development, and other advantages. In this study, a new clinical decision support system was developed for individuals to detect epileptic seizures using EEG signals. Comprehensive classification results were obtained for the extracted filtered features fromthe time-frequency domain. The classification accuracies of the time-frequency features obtained from discrete continuous transform (DCT), fractional Fourier transform (FrFT), and Hilbert transform (HT) are compared. Artificial neural networks (ANN) were applied, and back propagation (BP) was used as a learning method. Many studies in the literature describe a single BP algorithm. In contrast, we looked at several BP algorithms including gradient descent withmomentum (GDM), scaled conjugate gradient (SCG), and gradient descent with adaptive learning rate (GDA). The most successful algorithm was tested using simulations made on three separate datasets (DCT_EEG, FrFT_EEG, and HT_EEG) that make up the input data. The HT algorithm was the most successful EEG feature extractor in terms of classification accuracy rates in each EEG dataset and had the highest referred accuracy rates of the algorithms. As a result, HT_EEG gives the highest accuracy for all algorithms, and the highest accuracy of 87.38% was produced by the SCG algorithm. © 2021 Tech Science Press.

The unpredictable nature of the epilepsy seizures deprives the patients and those around them of living a normal life. Therefore, the development of new methods that can help these patients will increase the life quality of these people and can bring a lot of economic savings in the health sector. Methods: In this study, we introduced a new framework for seizure onset detection. Our framework provides a new modelling for brain activity using evolutionary game theory and Kalman filter. If the patterns in the electroencephalogram (EEG) signal violate the predicted patterns by the proposed model, using a novel detection algorithm that has been also introduced in this paper, it can be determined whether the observed violation is the result of the onset of an epileptic seizure or not. Results: The proposed approach was able to detect the onset of all the seizures in CHB-MIT dataset with an average delay of −0.8 s and a false alarm of 0.39 per hour. Also, our proposed approach is about 20 times faster compared to recent studies. Conclusions: The experimental results of applying the proposed framework on the CHB-MIT dataset show that our framework not only performed well with respect to the sensitivity, delay, and false alarm metrics but also performed much better in terms of run time compared to recent studies. This appropriate run time, along with other suitable metrics, makes it possible to use this framework in many cases where processing power or energy is limited and to think about creating new and inexpensive solutions for the treatment and care of people diagnosed with epilepsy. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cmpb.2020.105899,10.1016/j.cmpb.2020.105899,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85098078989&doi=10.1016%2fj.cmpb.2020.105899&partnerID=40&md5=a9adc7ddb10f5b638313b32405b3014a,2021,28/03/2024 1:15,28/03/2024 1:15,,,,,199,,Comput.

The diagnosis of epileptic seizure involves the identification and different characteristic of the Electroencephalography (EEG) signal. As such, it needs a method for identifying and classifying epileptic seizure. Deep learning is part of a neural network that has the ability and pattern to identify and classify epileptic seizure. CNN has been demonstrated high performance on image classification and pattern detection. In this paper, we combine the continuous wavelet transform (CWT) and CNN to classify epileptic seizure. This experiment uses the wavelet transform to convert signal data of EEG to time-frequency domain images. The output of the wavelet transform is an image that will classify into five attributes. In this experiment, we develop a simple program that will compare with other CNN approach (AlexNet and GoogleNet). The results of this experiment are two kinds of data, accuracy, and loss. The resulting accuracy is 72.49%, and the loss is 0.576.

However, real-time seizure event and onset detection in an ambulatory epilepsy patient using continuous scalp EEG monitoring proves to be difficult with the hardware associated with signal acquisition. Furthermore, developing a universal seizure detection algorithm is not applicable due to the patient dependence. The prominent challenge in working with EEG its non-stationarity. Hence, time-frequency methods such as wavelet analysis have been used in recent research, to develop algorithms. In this study, we develop patient specific seizure detection system in which, Discrete Wavelet Packet Transform (DWPT) is used to extract wavelet packet energy and use a single EEG channel to train an offline SVM classifier. This study is conducted to prove that accurate seizure prediction can be performed using at most two channels for most patients and develop a system for real-time monitoring and seizure event detection. The objective is to maintain a high level of accuracy despite the drastic reduction in spatial features and achieve a low latency of detection so that this algorithm could be used in seizure alert devices with less hardware complexity.

It is diagnosed by analyzing a long electroencephalogram (EEG) recording in a clinical environment, which may be much prone to errors and a time-consuming task. In this paper, a methodology for the classification of an epileptic seizure is proposed for analyzing EEG signals. EEG signal is decomposed into intrinsic mode functions (IMFs) using empirical mode decomposition (EMD). A fusion, of the extracted non-linear and spike-based features from each of the IMF signals, is made. The parameters of five machine learning algorithms; k-nearest neighbor (k-NN), extreme learning machine (ELM), random forest (RF), support vector machine (SVM), and artificial neural network (ANN) are optimized, as well as a set of the significant features is chosen using grasshopper optimization algorithm (GOA). These classifiers with their optimized parameters are ensembled together for the classification of epileptic seizures. The results show that ensemble classifier performs better than individual classifier. A comparison of the proposed methodology with state of the art epileptic seizure detection techniques is also made for validation.

Recently, automatic seizure onset detection frameworks fail to fully consider both nonstationary and stochastic characteristics of EEGs in nature, which may lead to information default and further produce suboptimal recognition performance consequently. In this work, we propose a patient-specific seizure onset detection method based on fully exploration of auxiliary supplementary spectral–temporal information in EEG signals. Specifically, prior to feature extraction procedure, EEG signals are firstly decomposed into 5 groups of coefficients at different levels based on the clinical interest. Representative feature in temporal-domain, which is a translation of the nonlinear property of EEG signals, is then extracted by a combination of principal component analysis and common spatial pattern (PCA-CSP) and multivariate multiscale sample entropy (MMSE) in parallel and dimensionally reduced by a tree-based feature selection algorithm. Supplementary information in spectral-domain is further explored by the proposed unified maximum mean discrepancy autoencoder (uMMD-AE). Finally, an optimal combination of features above is identified and fed into a series of support vector machine classifiers with a decision fusion module for the intelligent recognition of epileptic EEGs. The proposed method achieves an average sensitivity, latency and false detection rate of 97.2%, 1.10s and 0.64/h respectively on Children Hospital Boston-Massachusetts Institute of Technology (CHB-MIT) Scalp EEG Database.

709,INKG6QMS,journalArticle,2022,"Dhull, S.; Singh, K.K.",ESIMD: Epileptic seizure identification using metaheuristic deep learning technique,Expert Systems,,02664720 (ISSN),"The identification of epileptic seizure from electroencephalogram (EEG) segments is significant for seizure identification and classification. In epilepsy, the patients develop epileptic seizures. These lead to neurological disorders and abnormal brain activities. The manual identification of seizures is not very efficient. As the manual analysis of EEG data requires expert neurologists it is prone to inaccuracies. Therefore, automated methods for seizure identification are required. Deep learning methods have shown efficiency in the seizure classification problem. Many challenges are faced by the existing methods owing to the properties of the EEG signals like transiency, non-stationary behaviour and presence of noise. Therefore, to overcome these challenges and design a highly efficient method an automated method based on deep learning and spotted hyena optimization (SHO) algorithm is proposed. The SHO algorithm is used to initialize the network as it avoids the local minima problem. Epileptic seizure identification using metaheuristic deep learning (ESIMD) is proposed in this paper which is a hybridization of spotted hyena and deep convolution network. The convolutional neural network used has two blocks, the first block is used for feature extraction and the second block for seizure classification. ESIMD is used for seizure detection and classification. The proposed algorithm can handle the complex and large number of features in EEG signals. The performance of the proposed is evaluated by applying it on EEG Bonn Dataset. The results are compared with 13 other conventional methods. The comparative study shows that ESIMD gives higher accuracy than the existing methods. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",https://doi.org/10.1111/exsy.12897,10.1111/exsy.12897,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85120053099&doi=10.1111%2fexsy.12897&partnerID=40&md5=e5f52f849c3acafb43ac9be591bc378b,2022,28/03/2024 1:15,28/03/2024 1:15,,,,4,39,,Expert Syst,,,,,,,,English,,,Scopus,,,,,"<p>ASReview_relevant</p>; <p>Export Date: 13 February 2024; Cited By: 4; Correspondence Address: K.K.

Electroencephalogram (EEG) is considered an effective tool among neurologists to detect various brain disorders, including epilepsy, owing to its advantages, such as its low cost, simplicity, and availability. In order to reduce the severity of epileptic seizures, it is necessary to design effective techniques to identify the disease at an earlier stage. Since the traditional way of diagnosing epileptic seizures is laborious and time-consuming, automated tools using machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) models may be useful. This paper presents an intelligent deep canonical sparse autoencoder-based epileptic seizure detection and classification (DCSAE-ESDC) model using EEG signals. The proposed DCSAE-ESDC technique involves two major processes, namely, feature selection and classification. The DCSAE-ESDC technique designs a novel coyote optimization algorithm (COA)-based feature selection technique for the optimal selection of feature subsets. Moreover, the DCSAE-based classifier is derived for the detection and classification of different kinds of epileptic seizures. Finally, the parameter tuning of the DSCAE model takes place via the krill herd algorithm (KHA). The design of the COA-based feature selection and KHA-based parameter tuning shows the novelty of the work. For examining the enhanced classification performance of the DCSAE-ESDC technique, a detailed experimental analysis was conducted using a benchmark epileptic seizure dataset.

At outset, EEG signals are recorded from the patient and pre-processed to remove the unwanted signals: Dc drift elimination, high pass and low pass filter techniques are applied to preprocess the EEG signals. The noise is diminished from the signal by the method of Hilbert-Huang Transform (HHT). Empirical mode decomposition is the portion of HHT by which intrinsic mode functions (IMFs) are separated from the signal. In Hilbert spectral analysis, the instant frequency of IMFs is executed using Hilbert transform, which allows the finding of localized features. Empirical wavelet transform (EWT) is applied to acquire EWT components from the EEG signals. These features are further extracted in to five frequency subbands based on clinical interest. Genetic algorithm is structured for displaying the best features from the localized features. Based on the optimized features, support vector machine is applied to classify and evaluated the signals as epileptic seizure and seizure-free EEG signals.

Then, we perform the fast Fourier transform with wavelet scales 3, 4, 5, and 6, and take the magnitude of the Fourier coefficients as features for seizure detection. We use a nearest neighbour classifier to classify the input EEG signal into the seizure or no seizure class. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed method is comparable and sometimes better than our previous dual-tree complex wavelet–Fourier method for the University of Bonn EEG database.

In this study, we applied entropy analysis to electroencephalogram (EEG) data to examine its performance in epilepsy detection based on shortterm EEG, aiming at establishing a short-term analysis protocol with optimal seizure detection performance. Two classification problems were considered, i.e., 1) classifying interictal and ictal EEGs (epileptic group) from normal EEGs; and 2) classifying ictal from interictal EEGs. For each problem, we explored two protocols to analyze the entropy of EEG: i) using a single analytical window with different window lengths, and ii) using an average of multiple windows for each window length. Two entropy methods-fuzzy entropy (FuzzyEn) and distribution entropy (DistEn)-were used that have valid outputs for any given data lengths. We performed feature selection and trained classifiers based on a cross-validation process. The results show that performance of FuzzyEn and DistEn may complement each other and the best performance can be achieved by combining: 1) FuzzyEn of one 5-s window and the averaged DistEn of five 1-s windows for classifying normal from epileptic group (accuracy: 0.93, sensitivity: 0.91, specificity: 0.96); and 2) the averaged FuzzyEn of five 1-s windows and DistEn of one 5-s window for classifying ictal from interictal EEGs (accuracy: 0.91, sensitivity: 0.93, specificity: 0.90).

Firstly, Bonn and Freiburg datasets were used to perform experiments. The Bonn dataset consists of binary and multi-class classification problems, and the Freiburg dataset consists of two-class EEG classification problems. In the preprocessing step, all datasets were prepossessed using a Butterworth band pass filter with 0.5–60 Hz cut-off frequency. Then, the EEG signals of the datasets were segmented into different time windows. In this section, dual-tree complex wavelet transform (DT-CWT) was used to decompose the EEG signals into the different sub-bands. In the following section, in order to feature extraction, various FD techniques were used, including Higuchi (HFD), Katz (KFD), Petrosian (PFD), Hurst exponent (HE), detrended fluctuation analysis (DFA), Sevcik, box counting (BC), multiresolution box-counting (MBC), Margaos-Sun (MSFD), multifractal DFA (MF-DFA), and recurrence quantification analysis (RQA). In the next step, the minimum redun-dancy maximum relevance (mRMR) technique was used for feature selection. Finally, the k-nearest neighbors (KNN), support vector machine (SVM), and convolutional autoencoder (CNN-AE) were used for the classification step. In the classification step, the K-fold cross-validation with k = 10 was employed to demonstrate the effectiveness of the classifier methods. The experiment results show that the proposed CNN-AE method achieved an accuracy of 99.736% and 99.176% for the Bonn and Freiburg datasets, respectively. © 2021 by the authors.

Electroencephalogram (EEG) is a standard tool that has been widely used to detect seizures. A number of automated seizure detection systems based on EEG signal classification have been employed in present days, which includes a mixture of approaches but most of them rely on time signal features, time intervals or time frequency domains. Therefore, in this research, deep learning-based automated mechanism is introduced to improve the seizure detection accuracy from EEG signal using the Asymmetrical Back Propagation Neural Network (ABPN) method. The ABPN system includes four levels of repetitive training with weight adjustment, feed forward initialization, error and update weight and bias back-propagation. The proposed ABPN-based seizure detection system is validated using Physionet EEG dataset with matlab simulation, and the effectiveness of proposed seizure system is confirmed through simulation results. As compared with Deep Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Support Vector Machine–Particle Swarm Optimization (SVM-PSO)-based seizure detection system, the proposed ABPN system gives the best performance against various parameters.

In general, seizure detection is done manually in hospitals and involves time-consuming visual inspection and interpretation by experts of electroencephalography (EEG) recordings. The purpose of this study is to investigate the pertinence of band-limited spectral power and signal complexity in order to discriminate between seizure and seizure-free EEG brain activity. The signal complexity and spectral power are evaluated in five frequency intervals, namely, the delta, theta, alpha, beta, and gamma bands, to be used as EEG signal feature representation. Classification of seizure and seizure-free data was performed by prevalent potent classifiers. Substantial comparative performance evaluation experiments were performed on a large EEG data record of 341 patients in the Temple University Hospital EEG seizure database. Based on statistically validated criteria, results show the efficiency of band-limited spectral power and signal complexity when using random forest and gradient-boosting decision tree classifiers (95% of the area under the curve (AUC) and 91% for both F-measure and accuracy). These results support the use of these automatic classification schemes to assist the practicing neurologist interpret EEG records more accurately and without tedious visual inspection. © 2022 by the authors.

The study was done on the EEG of ictal and interictal phases of epileptic patients and of normal subjects. The EEG was decomposed using discrete wavelet transform to obtain various sub-bands and the chaotic features like correlation dimension and largest Lyapunov exponent were extracted. The analysis results clearly show that the correlation dimension and largest Lyapunov exponent have their lowest value during seizure activity, higher for interictal and even higher values for normal EEG. These values strongly suggest that interictal phase EEG of an epileptic patient is less complex and more predictable compared to normal EEG. Chaotic features extracted are potential parameters for automated diagnosis of epilepsy.

Since correctly diagnosing epilepsy seizures by monitoring the EEG signal is very tedious and time-consuming for a neurologist, a growing number of studies have been conducted on developing automated epileptic seizure detection (AESD). In this work, a novel supervised model is proposed for AESD. Initially, the EEG signals are collected from Bonn University EEG (BU-EEG) database. Then, empirical mode decomposition and feature extraction (combination of entropy, frequency, and statistical features) are applied to extract the features. Furthermore, Siamese network is utilized to lessen the number of extracted features and obtain the most discriminative features. Then, these features are exploited to classify seizure and non-seizure EEG signals by using a support vector machine classifier. This paper examines the Siamese network's contribution as a learning-based feature transformation in improving seizure detection performance. The numerical results confirm that the proposed framework can achieve a perfect classification performance (100% accuracy).

Auto seizure detection methods are developed by many researchers. Year by year new methods and new approaches are introduced by researchers to improve the performance of these automatic detection methods. Electroencephalogram (EEG) is the most widely used tool for detecting seizure as it has high resolution which makes it more feasible for analysis. In this paper we are introducing an approach based on stacked bidirectional long short term memory with global average pooling (LSTM_GAP) neural network for detecting epileptic seizure events. We use open access EEG dataset available in Bonn University Germany for the experiment. The model is evaluated based on three performance metrics, specificity, sensitivity and accuracy. It resulted with outstanding performance with 100% accuracy, sensitivity and specificity in detecting epileptic seizure events which is the highest accuracy among all the techniques available in state-of-the art literature. Another advantage of LSTM_GAP model lies in its robustness in noise. In real, the EEG recorded in hospital laboratories consists of artefacts generated from eye blink and muscle activities of the patients. When our model will be put to practical use by the neurologists, the EEG recordings consisting of artefacts will be given as input to the model for detecting seizure events. Hence we need to develop a model which is robust against noise and which can provide good results even when the EEG data consisting artefacts is given as input. Hence we extended our experiment to check the performance of the LSTM_GAP model by adding eye blink artefacts and muscle artefacts to the input EEG data. The model was able to give superior results even after adding artefacts. We were able to achieve 97.67% sensitivity, 98.83% specificity and 97.65% accuracy. Thus LSTM_GAP model gives superior results for the EEG with and without noise compared to other methods in the literature. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s12065-020-00459-9,10.1007/s12065-020-00459-9,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85088802666&doi=10.1007%2fs12065-020-00459-9&partnerID=40&md5=edba2b8560d3a859c84aa0435036d399,2021,28/03/2024 1:15,28/03/2024 1:15,,823-833,,2,14,,Evol.

Methods: This paper describes how features based on cross-bispectrum can help with the detection of epileptic seizure activity in EEG data. Features were extracted from multi-channel intracranial EEG (iEEG) data from the Freiburg iEEG recordings of 21 patients with focal epilepsy. These features were used as a support vector machine classifier input to discriminate ictal from inter-ictal states. A post-processing method was applied to the classifier output in order to improve classification accuracy. Results: A sensitivity of 95.8%, specificity of 96.7%, and accuracy of 96.8% were achieved. The false detection rate (FDR) was zero for 10 patients and very low for the rest. Conclusions: The results show that the proposed method distinguishes better between ictal and inter-ictal iEEG epochs than other seizure detection methods. The proposed method has a higher accuracy index than achievable with a number of previously described approaches.

Automatic seizure detection with Electroencephalogram (EEG) has witnessed great progress. However, existing methods paid little attention to the topological relationships of different EEG electrodes. Latest neuroscience researches have demonstrated the connectivity between different brain regions. Besides, class-imbalance is a common problem in EEG based seizure detection. The duration of epileptic EEG signals is much shorter than that of normal signals. In order to deal with the above mentioned two challenges, we propose to model the multi-channel EEG data using the Attention-based Graph ResNet (AGRN). In particular, each channel of the EEG signal represents a node of the graph and the inter-channel relations are modeled via the adjacency matrix in the graph. The loss function of the ARGN model is re-designed using focal loss to cope with the class-imbalance problem. The proposed ARGN with focal model could learn discriminative features from the raw EEG data. Experiments are carried out on the CHB-MIT dataset. The proposed model achieves an average accuracy of 98.70%, a sensitivity of 97.94%, a specificity of 98.66% and a precision of 98.62%.

Epileptic seizures can be a major life disability that might result in loss of consciousness, and/or injury to oneself or others. This research work aims to develop an epileptic seizure detection method using electroencephalography (EEG) signal analysis. We combine discrete wavelet transform (DWT), Shannon entropy, and statistical feature (standard deviation) to extract distinctive features of a given EEG signal. K-nearest neighbors (KNN) automatically classifies the EEG signal by comparing the extracted features with the features of the normal and seizure baseline. Adaptive learning is used to continuously update the two baselines based the user feedback, if needed, to improve its performance over the time.

Electroencephalography (EEG) is a powerful tool to measure the brain electrical activity and has been widely used for seizure detection. Manual EEG analysis is labor-intensive and time-consuming. Automatic seizure detection is urgently demanded for long-time seizure monitoring. Many methods have been proposed for automatic seizure detection based on EEG signals. However, most of the existing methods are patient-specific with limited generaliz-ability. Few studies investigate inter-patient seizure detection, which remains challenging. The aim of the present study is therefore to develop advanced algorithms for efficient inter-patient seizure detection using EEG. To this end, dynamic brain network is employed to capture the spatiotemporal dynamics of the connectivity among brain regions. A novel graph neural network referred to as graph isomorphic network is proposed for effective local-global spatiotemporal feature extraction and seizure classification. The proposed method is evaluated with the CHB-MIT open dataset with a ten-fold cross-validation. The results reveal excellent performance for the proposed method, with accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity of 96.2%, 95.4%, and 97.0% respectively, significantly higher than the results reported in the literature.

Yet, few investigations have been paid to the preictal stage detection, which is practically more crucial to epileptics in taking precautions before seizure onset. In this article, a novel epileptic preictal state classification and seizure detection algorithm based on deep features learned by stacked convolutional neural networks (SCNNs) is developed. The mean amplitude of sub-band spectrum map (MAS) obtained from the average sub-band spectra of multichannel EEGs is adopted for representation. The probability feature vectors by stacked convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are extracted in the softmax layer of CNNs, where an adaptive and discriminative feature weighting fusion (AWF) is developed for performance enhancement. Following the deep extraction layer, the effective kernel extreme learning machine (KELM) is adopted for feature learning and epileptic classification.

In this method, imaged-EEGs are made from the Short Time Fourier Transform (STFT) coefficients of two sequential epochs. The GLCMs of these images are calculated and one feature named diagGLCM is extracted from each co-occurrence matrix. This feature demonstrates the repetition of the STFT coefficient of a frequency band in two sequential epochs, which are used for a classification task between ictal (during a seizure) and inter-ictal (between seizures) time segments. Using one frequency band's STFT repetition, a patient-specific seizure detection algorithm is developed with an accuracy of 99.56%, a sensitivity of 99.52%, and specificity of 99.62%.

Epilepsy is a brain disorder characterized by uncontrolled excessive activity. Repeated abnormal disturbance or seizure causes epilepsy. Hence, EEG signals act as a diagnostic tool for epilepsy. An approach based on tree-based pipeline optimization tool (TPOT) is presented for classification of EEG signals as either seizure or normal activity in the brain. A binarized dataset with sampled signal levels and the corresponding class is subjected to a genetic approach for acquiring an optimized predictive model. In TPOT, the tedious process involved in machine learning being repeatedly performed until arriving at the best solution is automated using genetic algorithm, i.e., evaluate-select-crossover-mutate is repeated to tune the pipeline. In the settings used in this paper, there are 90 pipeline configurations for evaluation for which around 450 models are fitted and evaluated against the training data in one grid search. The best pipeline is the one with the highest cross-validation score in the run at 95.94%. The test accuracy is at 95.27% which is just a little lower than the cross-validation score.

Matthew,Epilepsy Detection Using Artificial Neural Network and Grasshopper Optimization Algorithm (GOA),"2019 15th International Conference on Electronics, Computer and Computation (ICECCO)",,,"Epilepsy affects about 1 % of the contemporary population and sternly reduces the wellbeing of its patients. It is a neurological disorder of the central nervous system that is usually characterized by sudden seizure. The possibility of detecting and predicting epileptic seizure has engrossed mankind already for over 35 years. One of the main tools in detecting and predicting the Epilepsy seizures are the Electroencephalograms (EEG), which record the brain activity by measuring the extracellular field potentials due to neuronal discharges. This EEG is quite difficult and complex to interpret even by an expert neurologist, even so, it is time-consuming, often challenging, sets in human error as well as delay in treatment. In this research, a hybrid classification model using Grasshopper Optimization Algorithm (GOA) and Artificial Neural Network (ANN) for automatic seizure detection in EEG is proposed called GOA-ANN approach. Nine parameters (mean value, variance value, Standard deviation value, energy value, entropy value and maximum value, RMS value, kurtosis and skewness) were extracted and used as the features to train the ANN classifiers. GOA was used for selecting the best features in order to obtain an effective EEG classification. In comparison with other research, the result was able to detect epilepsy and enhance the diagnosis of epilepsy with an accuracy of 98.4%.

Ser.,17426588 (ISSN),,"Epilepsy, as a common nervous system disease in the world, urgently needs effective methods for diagnosis and treatment. Scalp electroencephalogram (EEG) contains a lot of physiological and pathological information, which plays a very important role in the diagnosis of brain diseases such as epilepsy. At present, the clinical analysis of EEG signal is mainly based on the clinician's visual analysis, which makes the clinician's task heavy, and there is no quantitative standard for the analysis results. Therefore, the automatic classification of epileptic EEG signals has great potential in current clinical application. Based on the deep learning VGG16 convolutional neural network model, a method for automatic detection of seizure signals is proposed in this paper. Firstly, the samples are preprocessed, then enter the VGG16 convolutional neural network model for training, and finally input the validation set for validation. The experimental results indicate that this model can distinguish the pre-ictal EEG, interictal EEG and ictal EEG.  © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",https://doi.org/10.1088/1742-6596/2278/1/012026,10.1088/1742-6596/2278/1/012026,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85132025248&doi=10.1088%2f1742-6596%2f2278%2f1%2f012026&partnerID=40&md5=e999cf122d7f18de38a17efb023cc3a2,2022,28/03/2024 1:15,28/03/2024 1:15,,,,,2278,,,,,,,,Institute of Physics,,English,,,Scopus,,,,,"<p>ASReview_relevant</p>; <p>Export Date: 13 February 2024; Cited By: 0; Correspondence Address: L.

The performance of 5 different data sets combination classifications is studied using the probabilistic neural network (PNN), learning vector quantization neural network (LVQ) and Elman neural network (ENN). Different feature combinations serve as the input vectors of the classifiers to obtain the best outcomes. It has been found that PNN has less running time and provides better classification accuracy (CA) than ENN and LVQ classifiers for all 5 classification problems. It is worth noticing that the CA for the C-D classification task, which shows the status of pre-ictal versus post-ictal, has been greatly improved, and reached 83.13%.

For its detection, Electroencephalogram (EEG) is an important noninvasive diagnostic approach. This paper proposes a new automated real-time approach for EEG epileptic seizure detection based on serial concatenation of Quantized Kernel Least Mean Square (QKLMS) adaptive filters. The QKLMS filter is employed in the proposed system to achieve accurate real-time diagnosis with low hardware complexity. In the proposed serial concatenation filter design, the energy of prediction signal is investigated to detect the seizure interval on the EEG records and to classify healthy, epileptic inter-ictal, and epileptic ictal cases. The Grey Wolf Optimizer (GWO) algorithm is employed to find the optimum values of the energy threshold and the parameters of the QKLMS algorithm. The performance of the proposed QKLMS technique is compared with other adaptive filters, and the results reveal the superior performance of the QKLMS algorithm. The proposed system is examined with real EEG records taken from the Bonn University database, and the experimental results show that the proposed epileptic seizure detection system outperforms other state-of-the-art systems with an accuracy of 97.88 %, sensitivity of 98.80 %, specificity of 97.65 %, and computational time of 0.58 sec.

In this paper, we have proposed the new features based on the phase space representation (PSR) for classification of epileptic seizure and seizure-free EEG signals. The EEG signals are firstly decomposed using empirical mode decomposition (EMD) and phase space has been reconstructed for obtained intrinsic mode functions (IMFs). For the purpose of classification of epileptic seizure and seizure-free EEG signals, two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) PSRs have been used. New features based on the 2D and 3D PSRs of IMFs have been proposed for classification of epileptic seizure and seizure-free EEG signals. Two measures have been defined namely, 95% confidence ellipse area for 2D PSR and interquartile range (IQR) of the Euclidian distances for 3D PSR of IMFs of EEG signals. These measured parameters show significant difference between epileptic seizure and seizure-free EEG signals. The combination of these measured parameters for different IMFs has been utilized to form the feature set for classification of epileptic seizure EEG signals. Least squares support vector machine (LS-SVM) has been employed for classification of epileptic seizure and seizure-free EEG signals, and its classification performance has been evaluated using different kernels namely, radial basis function (RBF), Mexican hat wavelet and Morlet wavelet kernels. Simulation results with various performance parameters of classifier, have been included to show the effectiveness of the proposed method for classification of epileptic seizure and seizure-free EEG signals.

Studies have shown that epilepsy can be detected in electroencephalography (EEG) recordings of patients suffering from seizures. The performance of EEG-based epileptic seizure detection relies largely on h ow well one can extract features from an EEG that characterize seizure activity. Conventional feature extraction methods using time-series analysis, spectral analysis and nonlinear dynamic analysis have advanced in recent years to improve detection. The computational complexity has also increased to obtain a higher detection rate. This study aimed to develop an efficient feature extraction method based on Hjorth's mobility to reduce computational complexity while maintaining high detection accuracy. A new feature extraction method was proposed by computing the spectral power of Hjorth's mobility components, which were effectively estimated by differentiating EEG signals in real-time. Using EEG data in five epileptic patients, this method resulted in a detection rate of 99.46% between interictal and epileptic EEG signals and 99.78% between normal and epileptic EEG signals, which is comparable to most advanced nonlinear methods. These results suggest that the spectral features of Hjorth's mobility components in EEG signals can represent seizure activity and may pave t h e way for developing a fast a nd reliable epileptic seizure detection method. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.compbiomed.2015.04.034,10.1016/j.compbiomed.2015.04.034,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84956842544&doi=10.1016%2fj.compbiomed.2015.04.034&partnerID=40&md5=3924039f0ecdefacc244b3df5e8aa639,2015,28/03/2024 1:15,28/03/2024 1:15,,352-356,,,66,,Comput.

Experimental results from the Children's Hospital Boston-Massachusetts Institute of Technology (CHB-MIT) dataset show the computational efficiency of the proposed method (analyzing EEG signals in a time window of 3 s within 0.1 s using a Core i7 PC) while providing comparable results to the existing methods in terms of average sensitivity, latency, and false detection rate. The proposed method is advantageous for real-time monitoring of epileptic patients and could be used to improve early diagnosis and treatment of patients suffering from recurrent seizures.",https://doi.org/10.1109/JBHI.2017.2703873,10.1109/JBHI.2017.2703873,,2018-01,28/03/2024 1:15,28/03/2024 1:15,,154-160,,1,22,,,,,,,,,,English,,,,WOS:000419560100018,,,,<p>ASReview_relevant</p>; Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;39<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;45<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;32,,,epilepsy; Common spatial patterns; principal component analysis; seizure onset detection; ALGORITHM; INTRACRANIAL EEG; BRAIN; electro-encephalogram,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Yes,,,,Include,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Having epilepsy means frequent seizures, impaired motor and sensory functions, and a hampered normal lifestyle. Neurologists diagnose epileptic seizures by observing EEG signals visually or manually.

Wavelet-based four time-frequency features are extracted named energy, amount of fluctuation, coefficient of variation, and recursive energy efficiency.

Recent approaches involve the decomposition of EEG signals into different modes in a data-dependent and adaptive way, which may provide advantages over commonly used Fourier based methods when dealing with nonlinear and non-stationary data. Examples of such methods include empirical mode decomposition (EMD), extended EMD (EEMD), complete EEMD with adaptive noise (CEEMDAN), empirical wavelet transform (EWT) and variational mode decomposition (VMD). In this work, feature sets extracted from original non-decomposed signals and from the aforementioned adaptive decomposition methods are evaluated for the classification of EEG seizure data using two freely available datasets. We provide a previously unavailable common methodology for comparing the performance of these methods for EEG seizure detection, with the use of the same classifiers, parameters and spectral and time domain features. Overall, results were similar between the evaluated decomposition methods, with slightly superior values for VMD and CEEMDAN. Features extracted from the original non-decomposed signals resulted in inferior class separability, but fairly accurate predictions could still be achieved with specific classifiers. The evaluated decomposition methods are promising approaches for seizure detection, but their use should be judiciously analysed, especially in situations that require real-time processing and computational power is an issue. Another contribution of this work is the development of python packages for EWT (ewtpy) and VMD (vmdpy), already available at the PyPI repository. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bspc.2020.102073,10.1016/j.bspc.2020.102073,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85089242031&doi=10.1016%2fj.bspc.2020.102073&partnerID=40&md5=e8c5aeed336d0d2ab425e7ac7450fd00,2020,28/03/2024 1:15,28/03/2024 1:15,,,,,62,,Biomed.

People with epilepsy experience repeated seizures more than once in 24 hours. There are various ways to analyze seizures, one of them is by examining the electroencephalogram (EEG) signal recording. Neurologists usually do manual seizure analysis, yet it is time-consuming, tedious, and costive. Thus, an automated system of seizure detection is needed to assist the analysis. In this study, EEG signals of the CHB-MIT dataset are evaluated in digital signal processing using a machine learning approach. The EEG signals are filtered by applying a Butterworth bandpass filter (BPF). The mean channel selection is then applied to simplify the number of channels used in all patients. The channels are selected based on the energy value. Wavelet Packet Decomposition (WPD) is used to decompose the signals into several scales. The features are extracted using two entropy analyses, the Shannon Entropy (ShEN) and Renyi's Entropy (RE). This study used the Support Vector Machine (SVM) to classify the feature set. The channel selection process reduced the processed channels into two to five channels.

Advances in predicting epileptic seizures can promise a robust model in which seizures and irreparable injuries at the time of occurrence can be possible.

We present the usage of upto third order temporal moments, and spectral features including spectral centroid, coefficient of variation and the spectral skew of the IMFs for feature extraction from EEG signals.

Therefore, automated systems for epilepsy detection are required to help neurologists in diagnosing epilepsy. These automated systems act as supporting systems for the neurologists to diagnose epilepsy with good accuracy in less time. In this paper an attempt is made to develop an automated seizure detection method using deep neural network using the dataset collected from Bonn University, Germany. The results of the experiment are compared with the existing machine learning method. Our model gives better results compared to ML methods without the need of feature extraction. It is important to perform normalization of the dataset using feature scaling techniques to obtain good accuracy in the results. In this experiment we also worked on feature scaling of the dataset. At first we tried using StandardScaler and calculated loss using mean squared error. For this we achieved an accuracy of 97.21%, Sensitivity 98.17%, Specificity 94.93%, F1_score 98.48%, MCC 91.96% and ROC 97.55%. Experiment was continued to compare the performance of four different feature scaling techniques and four different loss functions. From the experimental results it was observed that StandardScaler and RobustScaler are equally good and are the best feature scaling techniques.

The Electroencephalogram dataset studied in present work includes trials from non-seizure, pre-seizure and seizure EEG activity. Proposed methodology is carried out in three methodological steps. In first step, Electroencephalogram activity is decomposed into optimum number of time–frequency sub-bands using TQWT. In second step, three nonlinear features viz. approximate entropy, Higuchi’s fractal dimension and Katz’s fractal dimension are estimated from decomposed sub-bands and four feature vectors are prepared. Classification of estimated feature vector is performed using two soft computing techniques viz. support vector machine and random forest tree classifier in the third step.

However, the potential of deep neural networks in seizure detection has not been fully exploited in terms of the optimal design of the model architecture and the detection power of the time-series brain data. In this work, a deep neural network architecture is introduced to learn the temporal dependencies in Electroencephalogram (EEG) data for robust detection of epileptic seizures. Methods: A deep Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network is first used to learn the high-level representations of different EEG patterns. Then, a Fully Connected (FC) layer is adopted to extract the most robust EEG features relevant to epileptic seizures. Finally, these features are supplied to a softmax layer to output predicted labels. Results: The results on a benchmark clinical dataset reveal the prevalence of the proposed approach over the baseline techniques; achieving 100% classification accuracy, 100% sensitivity, and 100% specificity. Our approach is additionally shown to be robust in noisy and real-life conditions. It maintains high detection performance in the existence of common EEG artifacts (muscle activities and eye movement) as well as background noise. Conclusions: We demonstrate the clinical feasibility of our seizure detection approach achieving superior performance over the cutting-edge techniques in terms of seizure detection performance and robustness.

Its diagnosis is generally performed using electroencephalography (EEG). But, the process of visually inspecting the EEG signals to trance out the seizure patterns has always been very time consuming and difficult. Researchers have continuously tried to automate the process of recognizing ictal patterns. But, the complexity and high erroneous outcomes from most of the deployed expert systems continues to limit practical realization. In this study, authors have presented a simple yet novel methodology to detect ictal patterns in EEG signals. The proposed model used intrinsic mode functions to plot 3D phase trajectories. The mean values of Euclidean distances calculated from these trajectories were used as input feature vectors to probabilistic neural network classifier. The outcomes from the classifier discriminated between the seizure and seizure-free patterns with ∼98 % accuracy. The model achieved similar statistical performance in < 0.03 s.

Numerous works have attempted to develop tools that can provide an assistant to neurophysiologist in analyzing the EEG for epileptic seizures detection. This paper proposes a new automatic framework to identify and classify the epileptic seizure from EEG using a machine learning method. In particular, the feature extraction process of the proposed scheme utilizes autoregressive model (AR) and firefly optimization (FA) to procure an optimal model order (P). Namely, the main aim of FA is to find the best model order (P) with minimum residual variance using Akaike information criterion (AIC) as an objective function of FA algorithm. A support vector machine (SVM) classifier is employed for the classification of the epileptic seizures signals. The presented scheme is also effective for short segment of EEG signals owing to use of AR model in features extraction stage.

This study develops a new scheme based on Douglas-Peucker algorithm (DP) and principal component analysis (PCA) for extraction of representative and discriminatory information from epileptic EEG data. As the multichannel EEG signals are highly correlated and are in large volumes, the DP algorithm is applied to extract the most representative samples from EEG data. The PCA is utilised to produce uncorrelated variables and to reduce the dimensionality of the DP samples for better recognition. To verify the robustness of the proposed method, four machine learning techniques, random forest classifier (RF), k-nearest neighbour algorithm (k-NN), support vector machine (SVM), and decision tree classifier (DT), are employed on the obtained features. Furthermore, we assess the performance of the proposed methods by comparing it with some recently reported algorithms. The experimental results show that the DP technique effectively extracts the representative samples from EEG signals compressing up to over 47% sample points of EEG signals. The results also indicate that the proposed feature method with the RF classifier achieves the best performance and yields 99.85% of the overall classification accuracy (OCA).

Electroencephalogram (EEG) measures electrical activity of the brain that is commonly applied as a non-invasive technique for seizure detection. Although a vast number of publications have been published on intelligent algorithms to classify interictal and ictal EEG, it remains an open question whether they can be detected using short-length EEG recordings. In this study, we proposed three protocols to select 5 s EEG segment for classifying interictal and ictal EEG from normal. We used the publicly-accessible Bonn database, which consists of normal, interical, and ictal EEG signals with a length of 4097 sampling points (23.6 s) per record. In this study, we selected three segments of 868 points (5 s) length from each recordings and evaluated results for each of them separately. The well-studied irregularity measure-sample entropy (SampEn)-and a more recently proposed complexity measure-distribution entropy (DistEn)-were used as classification features. A total of 20 combinations of input parameters m and t for the calculation of SampEn and DistEn were selected for compatibility. Results showed that SampEn was undefined for half of the used combinations of input parameters and indicated a large intra-class variance. Moreover, DistEn performed robustly for short-length EEG data indicating relative independence from input parameters and small intra-class fluctuations. In addition, it showed acceptable performance for all three classification problems (interictal EEG from normal, ictal EEG from normal, and ictal EEG from interictal) compared to SampEn, which showed better results only for distinguishing normal EEG from interictal and ictal. Both SampEn and DistEn showed good reproducibility and consistency, as evidenced by the independence of results on analysing protocol. © 2016 Li, Karmakar, Yan, Palaniswami and Liu.",https://doi.org/10.3389/fphys.2016.00136,10.3389/fphys.2016.00136,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84966709245&doi=10.3389%2ffphys.2016.00136&partnerID=40&md5=74b003d4be627088e76004f00323ecf8,2016,28/03/2024 1:15,28/03/2024 1:15,,,,APR,7,,Front.

However, some of these nonlinear measures cannot achieve satisfying performance without considering the basic rhythms of epileptic EEGs. New method To overcome the defects, this paper proposed a framework on wavelet-based nonlinear features and extreme learning machine (ELM) for the seizure detection. Three nonlinear methods, i.e., approximate entropy (ApEn), sample entropy (SampEn) and recurrence quantification analysis (RQA) were computed from orignal EEG signals and corresponding wavelet decomposed sub-bands separately. The wavelet-based energy was measured as the comparative. Then the combination of sub-band features was fed to ELM and SVM classifier respectively. Results The decomposed sub-band signals show significant discrimination between interictal and ictal states and the union of sub-band features helps to achieve better detection. All the three nonlinear methods show higher sensitivity than the wavelet-based energy analysis using the proposed framework. The wavelet-based SampEn-ELM detector reaches the best performance with a sensitivity of 92.6% and a false detection rate (FDR) of 0.078. Compared with SVM, the ELM detector is better in terms of detection accuracy and learning efficiency. Comparison with existing method(s) The decomposition of original signals into sub-bands leads to better identification of seizure events compared with that of the existing nonlinear methods without considering the time-frequency decomposition.

Firstly, we used a band-pass filter with 0.5–40 Hz cut-off frequency for removal artifacts of the EEG datasets. TunableQ Wavelet Transform (TQWT) is used for EEG signal decomposition. In the second step, various linear and nonlinear features are extracted from TQWT sub-bands. In this step, various statistical, frequency, and nonlinear features are extracted from the sub-bands. The nonlinear features used are based on fractal dimensions (FDs) and entropy theories. In the classification step, different approaches based on conventional machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) are discussed. In this step, a CNN–RNN-based DL method with the number of layers proposed is applied.

Currently, traditional seizure detection methods based only on single-view features have great limitations for the typical dynamic and nonlinear EEG signals. An objective of this paper is to investigate the effect of multiview feature selection and multilevel spectral analysis methods on the identification of the EEG signals for seizure detection. Here, multiview features are extracted from time domain, frequency domain, and information theory to collect adequate information of EEG signals. And a feature selection algorithm based on particle swarm optimization (PSO) is proposed for automatic seizure detection. Moreover, due to the different frequency components of the EEG signals, they are divided into four kinds of brain waves for multilevel spectral analysis. The effect of these four rhythm waves on seizure detection is compared. Three well-known classifiers are employed to classify EEG signals concerning seizure or nonseizure events. The result shows that the average accuracy, specificity, and sensitivity of classification with the CHB-MIT database are 98.14%, 98.64%, and 96.79%, respectively. The application of the PSO-based feature selection method for automatic seizure detection improves accuracy by 5.99% with the SVM classifier. Compared with the state-of-the-art methods, the proposed method has superior competence with high performance for automatic seizure detection. It is further shown that the feature selection method is an indispensable step in seizure detection. With PSO-based feature selection and multilevel spectral analysis, the θ wave in the frequency range of 4-7 Hz shows better performance in the identification of EEG signals and is more suitable for the proposed method. The PSO-based feature selection algorithm for automatic seizure detection can be a useful assistant tool for clinical diagnosis.  © 2022 Qi Sun et al.",https://doi.org/10.1155/2022/6585800,10.1155/2022/6585800,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85141716618&doi=10.1155%2f2022%2f6585800&partnerID=40&md5=1b906b7c34e7cdb21090e3a34258761e,2022,28/03/2024 1:15,28/03/2024 1:15,,,,,2022,,J.

Zhang,A Multi-View Deep Learning Framework for EEG Seizure Detection,IEEE Journal of Biomedical and Health Informatics,,2168-2208,"The recent advances in pervasive sensing technologies have enabled us to monitor and analyze the multi-channel electroencephalogram (EEG) signals of epilepsy patients to prevent serious outcomes caused by epileptic seizures. To avoid manual visual inspection from long-term EEG readings, automatic EEG seizure detection has garnered increasing attention among researchers. In this paper, we present a unified multi-view deep learning framework to capture brain abnormalities associated with seizures based on multi-channel scalp EEG signals. The proposed approach is an end-to-end model that is able to jointly learn multi-view features from both unsupervised multi-channel EEG reconstruction and supervised seizure detection via spectrogram representation. We construct a new autoencoder-based multi-view learning model by incorporating both inter and intra correlations of EEG channels to unleash the power of multi-channel information. By adding a channel-wise competition mechanism in the training phase, we propose a channel-aware seizure detection module to guide our multi-view structure to focus on important and relevant EEG channels. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed framework, extensive experiments against nine baselines, including both traditional handcrafted feature extraction and conventional deep learning methods, are carried out on a benchmark scalp EEG dataset. Experimental results show that the proposed model is able to achieve higher average accuracy and f1-score at 94.37% and 85.34%, respectively, using 5-fold subject-independent cross validation, demonstrating a powerful and effective method in the task of EEG seizure detection.",https://doi.org/10.1109/JBHI.2018.2871678,10.1109/JBHI.2018.2871678,,2019-01,28/03/2024 1:15,28/03/2024 1:15,,83-94,,1,23,,IEEE Journal of Biomedical and Health Informatics,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,<p>ASReview_relevant</p>,,,Deep learning; Electroencephalography; electroencephalogram; feature extraction; epileptic seizure; Scalp; Feature extraction; Brain modeling; multi-view learning; Machine learning; Spectrogram; Informatics,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,yes,,,,Include,,,Deep Learning,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Considering the aforesaid fact, in this paper, we propose a novel approach for automated detection and classification of focal electroencephalography (EEG) signals. In this contribution, we procured the focal and non focal EEG signals recorded from the temporal lobe epileptic patients and decomposed the recorded EEG data into several brain rhythms to obtain their time variation of different neural oscillations. Then, we selected a random EEG signal from each rhythm as a reference and performed cross wavelet transform (XWT) of the rest of the EEG rhythms with their respective chosen reference rhythms to examine their nature of correlation in both time scale and time-frequency frame. Finally, the obtained cross-rhythm spectrum time-frequency image plots were fed to a customized CNN model for the purpose of automated feature extraction and classification of EEG signals. The performance of the proposed CNN model was also compared with two pre-trained benchmark CNN models namely AlexNet and VGGNet16, respectively. We observed that the proposed EEG signal classification framework has delivered 100% accuracy for the delta ( $\delta$ ) rhythm and that too at a significantly reduced training time compared to the existing state-of-the-art CNN models.

Automated epileptic seizure detection has been widely studied so far, which brings great support to patients' health and quality of life. However, a well-trained patient-specific seizure detection model usually shows poor performance when classifying electroencephalogram (EEG) signals of a new patient. This may due to the huge individual differences in physiological signals. More specifically, the distribution of feature space across patients differ greatly from each other. In this study, we firstly extracted highly separable features from dual-tree discrete wavelet parameters. Then we employed transfer component analysis (TCA) to construct a latent feature subspace. Features of different patients share a similar distribution when projected onto the latent subspace, so that a model trained on existing patients can be applied to a new one. Through validation on an open access scalp EEG dataset which contains EEG signals of 24 epileptic patients, the model trained in TCA feature subspace outperforms that trained in original feature space when applied to new patients excluded from the training set.",https://doi.org/10.1109/BIOCAS.2019.8919154,10.1109/BIOCAS.2019.8919154,,17/10/2019,28/03/2024 1:15,28/03/2024 1:15,,1-Apr,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,<p>ASReview_relevant</p>,,,Electroencephalography; Training; Feature extraction; Brain modeling; Machine learning; Robustness; transfer learning; Detectors; automated seizure detection; transfer component analysis,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2019 IEEE Biomedical Circuits and Systems Conference (BioCAS),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,yes,,,,Include,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Excellent automatic detection algorithm of epilepsy will help healthcare workers to better treat epilepsy patients, which has important study significance. In this paper, we proposed a new epileptic seizure detection method based on time domain features and weighted complex network of electroencephalogram (EEG) signals. Firstly, each EEG segment is divided into four sub-segments and each sub-segment is divided into thirty-two clusters. A set of time domain features is extracted from each cluster. Then, each set of this features is used as a node of complex network. Features sets are converted into weighted horizontal visibility graph. Thirdly, average weighted degree of complex network is extracted as the classification feature. Finally, average weighted degree is inputted into a linear classifier to classify epileptic EEG signals. The experimental result shows that the classification accuracy is up to 96.5%.

Manual seizure identification on EEG by trained neurologists is time-consuming, labor-intensive and a reliable automatic seizure/non-seizure classification method is needed. One of the challenges in automatic seizure/non-seizure classification is that seizure morphologies exhibit considerable variabilities. In order to capture essential seizure patterns, this paper leverages an attention mechanism and a bidirectional long short-term memory (BiLSTM) to exploit both spatial and temporal discriminating features and overcome seizure variabilities. The attention mechanism captures spatial features according to the contributions of different brain regions to seizures. BiLSTM extracts discriminating temporal features in forward and backward directions. Cross-validation experiments and cross-patient experiments over the noisy data of CHB-MIT were performed. We obtained average sensitivity of 87.30%, specificity of 88.30% and precision of 88.29% in cross-validation experiments, higher than using the current state-of-the-art methods, and the standard deviations were lower.

The human examination for detecting the seizure activities in EEG signals is liable to errors. Apart from the errors, it is a time driven task and also the detection is not precise. In order to detect epileptic seizures more precisely various automatic systems have been emerged to assist neurophysiologists by researchers in various attempts. There are various limitations such as time-consuming, technical artifact issues, result variation with respect to reader expertise level, abnormalities identification. Enhanced Convolutional Neural Network (ECNN) is a technique proposed to mitigate the above mentioned limitations and to categorize more accurate epileptic seizures results. A novel automatic method to sense epileptic seizures using feature extraction and detection is proposed in this research. Linear filter is helpful in reducing the noise along with artifacts when the EEG signals are preprocessed. The noise can be still removed by applying Least Mean Square algorithm. In this proposed research the features are extracted via analytic time frequency with Cascaded wavelet transform and fractal dimension (FD) in order to detect epileptic seizures. Lastly, to analyze the EEG signal for better classification performance of the given dataset, ECNN is adopted. During this research to classify normal, preictal, and seizure classes, a 13-layer deep ECNN algorithm is implemented. This research has special characteristics such that the model yields promising classification accuracy. The experimental result demonstrates that the proposed ECNN is superior in terms of higher sensitivity, specificity, accuracy and lower time complexity rather than the existing methods. © BEIESP.",https://doi.org/10.35940/ijeat.A1204.109119,10.35940/ijeat.A1204.109119,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85074585879&doi=10.35940%2fijeat.A1204.109119&partnerID=40&md5=da0f847f6f3487e3b8c990d44e5730e2,2019,28/03/2024 1:15,28/03/2024 1:15,,1369-1376,,1,9,,Int.

Zhang,An Automatic Method for Epileptic Seizure Detection Based on Deep Metric Learning,IEEE Journal of Biomedical and Health Informatics,,2168-2208,"Electroencephalography (EEG) is a commonly used clinical approach for the diagnosis of epilepsy which is a life-threatening neurological disorder. Many algorithms have been proposed for the automatic detection of epileptic seizures using traditional machine learning and deep learning. Although deep learning methods have achieved great success in many fields, their performance in EEG analysis and classification is still limited mainly due to the relatively small sizes of available datasets. In this paper, we propose an automatic method for the detection of epileptic seizures based on deep metric learning which is a novel strategy tackling the few-shot problem by mitigating the demand for massive data. First, two one-dimensional convolutional embedding modules are proposed as a deep feature extractor, for single-channel and multichannel EEG signals respectively. Then, a deep metric learning model is detailed along with a stage-wise training strategy. Experiments are conducted on the publicly-available Bonn University dataset which is a benchmark dataset, and the CHB-MIT dataset which is larger and more realistic. Impressive averaged accuracy of 98.60% and specificity of 100% are achieved on the most difficult classification of interictal (subset D) vs ictal (subset E) of the Bonn dataset. On the CHB-MIT dataset, an averaged accuracy of 86.68% and specificity of 93.71% are reached. With the proposed method, automatic and accurate detection of seizures can be performed in real time, and the heavy burden of neurologists can be effectively reduced.",https://doi.org/10.1109/JBHI.2021.3138852,10.1109/JBHI.2021.3138852,,2022-05,28/03/2024 1:15,28/03/2024 1:15,,2147-2157,,5,26,,IEEE Journal of Biomedical and Health Informatics,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,<p>ASReview_relevant</p>,,,Deep learning; Electroencephalography; Training; epilepsy; Epilepsy; Convolution; Feature extraction; Brain modeling; electroencephalography (EEG); Measurement; metric learning,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,yes,,,,Include,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This paper proposed an epileptic seizures detection based on analysis of EEG signals. The detection is carried out firstly recording the EEG signals using the EEG device. The noise is then eliminated before features extraction process is carried out using HOS-WPD.

Comput.,21945357 (ISSN); 978-981106976-5 (ISBN),,"ElectroEncephaloGram (EEG) signals play an important role to identify epileptic disorders. Epilepsy is a neurological disorder that is an unexpected electrical disruption of the brain, because the activity of nerve cells in the brain becomes disrupted, causing people to experience “seizures.” Nowa-day, researcher works and focuses on automatic analysis of EEG signals to classify epilepsy. The EEG signal recording system produces very long data. Thus, the classification of epileptic seizures requires a time-consuming process. This paper proposes a Support Vector Machine (SVM)-based automated seizure classification system using Approximation Entropy (ApEn). ApEn reduces patient data size without loss of information. ApEn is a statistical parameter that measures the amplitude value of an EEG signal current based on its previous amplitude value. In this paper, we measure sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy using SVM classifiers. The overall score as high as 98.62% can be achieved by using the proposed system to distinguish the epilepsy state (seizure class) from the normal state (non-seizure class) using the time domain method. © 2018, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.",https://doi.org/10.1007/978-981-10-6977-2_5,10.1007/978-981-10-6977-2_5,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85041702791&doi=10.1007%2f978-981-10-6977-2_5&partnerID=40&md5=843f21aea10053c1969d0337f764f054,2018,28/03/2024 1:15,28/03/2024 1:15,,45-52,,,671,,,,,,,,Springer Verlag,,English,,,Scopus,,,,,"<p>ASReview_relevant</p>; <p>Export Date: 13 February 2024; Cited By: 2; Correspondence Address: H.B.

Automated computational algorithms are used in clinical medicine for extracting this information that cannot be read directly by visual inspection. Nonetheless, difficulties arise in the extraction because the intrinsic rhythms of the waveforms vary with the changes in the state of the brain. That is the case for electroencephalogram (EEG) signals from Epileptic seizure events. Here, we address the extraction of information from EEG signals by using a novel methodology that quantitatively measures the intrinsic rhythms of EEG waveforms related to healthy or Epileptic seizure events. In this method, the customized wavelet is used to estimate the EEG rhythms and then the relevance analysis with Fuzzy entropy and Stochastic measure are used to discriminate between seizure free and seizure states.

Chen,Identification of Epileptic Seizures by Characterizing Instantaneous Energy Behavior of EEG,IEEE Access,,2169-3536,"Automatic seizure detection has been often treated as a classification problem that aims at determining the label of electroencephalogram (EEG) signals by computer science, as the EEG monitoring is a helpful adjunct to the diagnosis of epilepsy. In most existing work, the traditional signal energy of the EEG has been applied for classification, since the energy pattern of epileptic seizures differs from that of non-seizures. Although they are effective, the accuracy either heavily depends on additional information besides energy or is limited by the shortcoming of energy-based features. To address this issue, the proposed approach achieves the classification based on the instantaneous energy of the EEG signals instead. The proposed approach first measures the instantaneous energy related to changes in the EEG signals. Then, energy behavior over time is characterized by instantaneous energy-based features from different aspects. Finally, the classification is carried out on the features to produce output labels. By processing instantaneous energy, the information of energy evolution is involved. As such, the accuracy is improved without bringing in extra information besides energy, or complicated transformation. In multi-class problems, the proposed approach has obtained promising results for identifying the ictal EEG, which indicates the tremendous potential of the proposed approach for epileptic seizure detection.",https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2919158,10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2919158,,2019,28/03/2024 1:15,28/03/2024 1:15,,70059-70076,,,7,,IEEE Access,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,<p>ASReview_relevant</p>,,,Electroencephalography; Feature extraction; Seizure identification; Time-frequency analysis; Neurons; Energy measurement; electroencephalogram (EEG) signal; energy behavior; instantaneous energy,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,yes,,,,Include,,,Machine Learning,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This paper proposes a new spectrogram-based deep learning method for the detection and anticipation of epileptic seizures. Unlike the existing methods, the proposed method formulates the feature descriptor such that it retains the neighborhood order of spectrograms both in time and frequency, while significantly reducing the dimensionality of the feature descriptor. The spectrogram in each of the 18 EEG channels is constructed by dividing each EEG signal into 3 time-blocks and 19 frequency-blocks. The mean magnitude value of each of these blocks is computed and thereby compactly representing the input EEG signal by a 3D tensor of size 18×19×3. This tensor descriptor is given as an input to the proposed convolution neural network for learning high-level features. Evaluations are performed on a publicly available EEG dataset of 23 patients and the results from the proposed method are compared with 9 other existing methods.

An epileptic patient can derive confidence from the fact that effective treatment can be administered to them efficiently. Acquiring real-time data of ictal and inter-ictal states of epileptic patients is crucial for real-time epileptic seizure detection. To meet this requirement, an indigenous system is developed in this research work. This system can gather data of epileptic patients as well as that of healthy patients, thereby, enabling the researcher to distinguish between the pre-ictal, inter-ictal, ictal, and healthy states. The real-time Electroencephalography signals of healthy persons and data of ictal and inter-ictal states of epileptic patients are gathered from the indigenous system. Using machine learning techniques, the data is extracted and classified to achieve high accuracy in the detection of epileptic seizure in real-time. Using the Discrete Wavelet Transform technique, the Mean and Standard Deviation are extracted from the last decomposition level of the frequency bands. The first component of Principal Component Analysis is used as a feature extraction process. Then, using a Quadratic Discriminant Classifier, the data of healthy persons and the data of the ictal state and inter-ictal state of epileptic patients is classified.

The seizure detection has a great importance in the diagnosis and therapy of epileptic patients. Visual inspection of the electroencephalogram (EEG) signals for detection of interictal, pre-ictal and ictal activities is a strenuous and time-consuming task due to the huge volumes of EEG segments that have to be studied. In this study, we proposed a novel automatic detection method based on the altered compressibility of EEG during the three states with compressive sensing. To evaluate the proposed method, segments of interictal, pre-ictal and ictal EEG segments (100 segments in each state) were used. Two entropies, namely the Sample Entropy (SE) and the permutation Entropy (PE), and Hurst Index (HI) were extracted respectively from the segments to compare with the proposed method. Significant features were selected using the ANOVA test. After evaluating the performance of the selected features by four classifiers (Decision Tree, K-Nearest Neighbor, Discriminant Analysis, Support Vector Machine) respectively, the results show that the proposed method can achieve the highest accuracy of 76.7%, which is higher than HI (55.3%), sample entropy (71%), and permutation entropy (73%). Hence, the altered compressibility of EEG with CS can act as a good biomarker for distinguish seizure-free, per-seizure and seizure state. In addition, compressive sensing requires less energy but has competitive compression ratio compared to traditional compression techniques, which enables our method to tele-monitoring of epilepsy patients using wireless body-area networks in personalized medicine.

These signals indicate the electrical activity in the brain and contain information about the brain. Epilepsy, one of the most important diseases in the brain, manifests itself as a result of abnormal pathological oscillating activity of a group of neurons in the brain. Automated systems that employed the electroencephalography signals are being developed for the assessment and diagnosis of epileptic seizures. The aim of this study is to focus on the effectiveness of stacking ensemble approach based model for predicting whether there is epileptic seizure or not. So, this study enables the readers and researchers to examine the proposed stacking ensemble model. The benchmark clinical dataset provided by Bonn University was used to assess the proposed model. Comparative experiments were conducted by utilizing the proposed model and the base deep neural networks model to show the effectiveness of the proposed model for seizure detection. Experiments show that the proposed model is proven to be competitive to base DNN model. The results indicate that the performance of the epileptic seizure detection by the stacking ensemble based deep neural networks model is high; especially the average accuracy value of 97.17%. Also, its average sensitivity with 93.11% is superior to the base DNN model. Thus, it can be said that the proposed model can be included in an expert system or decision support system.

Therefore, automated seizure detection systems are highly important to overcome the said challenges.

Its main clinical symptoms are paroxysmal convulsions, sensory disorders, consciousness and mental disorders, which seriously affect the daily life and work of patients. Seizure detection has always been a challenging work. With the increase of the incidence of epilepsy, high-performance epilepsy automatic detection algorithm can reduce the workload of medical workers in clinic, and has important significance in clinical medical research. This paper combines the characteristics of frequency domain and time domain with nonlinear analysis characteristics to extract features of EEG signals. Firstly, the average Periodic diagram method is used to calculate the power spectral density features, and then the wavelet transform is used to obtain the time domain analysis features. Next, the permutation entropy of five different rhythms are obtained by permutation entropy and information entropy algorithms. Finally, the three features with different dimensions are input into a linear classifier as a single feature to identify seizure and non-seizure signals. The performance of the proposed detection algorithm is evaluated by experiments on the epileptic EEG data-set of the University of Bonn.

Its main application is in the medical field and particularly the detection of epilepsy and epileptic seizures through electroencephalographic signals (EEG). It aims to design an intelligent framework that enables an immediate diagnosis of this disease without neurological consultation and thus saves the lives of the epileptic patients by detecting seizures and warning them before it happens. However, as a real-time application, this kind of framework faces several challenges such as accuracy, fast responses, and optimal memory usage. Within this context, our work was carried out. We propose a new machine learning framework based on chaos and fractal theories. Two main novelties are presented in this paper. Firstly, we propose a new method for signal preprocessing, and we reconstruct new versions of studied EEG signals using derivative determination and chaotic injection. Secondly, we suggest a new method for fractal analysis using Higuchi fractal dimension (HFD). In fact, HFDs extracted from EEG derivatives lead to detect epilepsy, whereas HFDs extracted from EEG with a chaotic signal injection lead to seizure detection. In addition, feature fusion helped to linearize all classification problems. An experimental study using the Bonn EEG database proves the efficiency of our contributions in comparison to published research. An accuracy of 100% was achieved in different classification cases using few features and a simple linear classifier.  © 2021 Zayneb Brari and Safya Belghith.",https://doi.org/10.1155/2021/2107113,10.1155/2021/2107113,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85113738509&doi=10.1155%2f2021%2f2107113&partnerID=40&md5=565028d66559e9510277ae31ef60af93,2021,28/03/2024 1:15,28/03/2024 1:15,,,,,2021,,Math.

The network is part of a classification system, which distinguishes among three brain states related to epilepsy namely ictal, interictal and healthy. Efficient methods for pre-processing EEG’s, extracting features and getting the final class decisions were selected using a statistical three-fold cross-validation method, which assures the robustness of the system and its generalization ability. The following methods were systematically analyzed to find the most appropriate for this problem: 1) Infinite Impulse Response (IIR) and Finite Impulse Response (FIR) filters for noise reduction; 2) discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) and Maximal Overlap Discrete Wavelet Transform (MODWT) for frequency decomposition of the EEG signals; 3) average correlation and maximum voting correlation for selecting a suitable mother wavelet for frequency decomposition; 4) Binary-tree and one-vs-one (OVO) decomposition strategies for primary binary classification; 5) voting and weighted-voting strategy aggregation strategies for the final classification. The integrated system was assessed using a three-fold cross validation, applied to a benchmark provided by the University of Bonn, getting an average accuracy of 93.33% when tested using sets Z, S and F and 95.0% when sets Z, S, F and O were used.

The workload of doctors to read the EEG signals of epilepsy patients can be effectively reduced by automatic seizure detection. The application of partial directed coherence (PDC) analysis as mechanism for feature extraction in the scalp EEG recordings for seizure detection could reflect the physiological changes of brain activity before and after seizure onsets. In this study, a new approach on the basis of PDC was proposed to detect the seizure intervals of epilepsy patients. First of all, the multivariate autoregressive model was established for a moving window and the direction and intensity of information flow based on PDC analysis was calculated. Then, the outflow information related to certain EEG channel could be obtained by summing up the intensity of information flow propagated to other EEG channels in order to reduce the feature dimensionality. At last, according to the pathological features of epileptic seizures, the outflow information was regarded as the input vectors to a support vector machine classifier for discriminating interictal periods and ictal periods of EEG signals.

Epileptic people suffer from recurrent seizures depending on many trigger factors such as genetic, physiologic, brain damage, etc. Epileptic seizures occur at unpredictable times and mostly without warning. During seizures, epileptic people have distraction or involuntary spasms that might even result in serious physical injuries or death. Therefore, the detection of epilepsy still challenges the neurologists in terms of prediction of seizure times and classifying the brain signals received from different zones of brain. This study presents an efficient procedure that provides an accurate classification of Electroencephalogram (EEG) signals for early detection of epileptic seizures. Essentially, this procedure hybridizes many tools such as artificial neural networks (ANNs), gradient based algorithms, genetic algorithms (GAs), feature extraction with discrete wavelet transforms (DWT) and fuzzy relations for reducing dimensionality of features. In analysis, ANNs are trained by the gradient based algorithms and GAs considering early stopping, cross-validation and information criteria. In order to ensure an accurate classification performance, the automated multi-resolution signal processing technique splits EEG signals into the detailed partitions with different bandwidths, and then decomposes them into detail and approximation coefficients by means of DWT at the different decomposition levels. Thus, some specific latent features that characterize the nonlinear and dynamical structures of EEG signals are acquired from these coefficients. The fuzzy relations bring out the significant components by reducing the dimension of feature matrix. To detect the epileptic behaviors in EEG signals, these selected components are processed by ANNs based cross-entropy and information criteria. According to analysis results, this approach not only allows making deeply analysis of EEG signals for detection of epilepsy, but also provides the best model configurations for ANNs in terms of reliability and complexity. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eswa.2017.07.020,10.1016/j.eswa.2017.07.020,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85025114673&doi=10.1016%2fj.eswa.2017.07.020&partnerID=40&md5=b0102f2ccd246d34bfe0c8f22fc86098,2017,28/03/2024 1:15,28/03/2024 1:15,,419-434,,,88,,Expert Sys Appl,,,,,,,,English,,,Scopus,,,,,"<p>ASReview_relevant</p>; <p>Export Date: 13 February 2024; Cited By: 80; Correspondence Address: O.

Epileptic episodes are detected by monitoring patients in order to provide preventive measures. Current research studies are using a combination of time and frequency features to recognize epileptic seizures automatically. In order to automatically detect epileptic seizures, different machine learning approaches have been used.

In terms of performance of GBDT, many machine learning tasks such as multi-class classification, learning to rank, etc. have reported competitive performance. In this paper, epileptic seizure recognition data is investigated and split into a binary and multi-class data set for which the GBDT method is applied.

Then the statistical features of the raw signal are extracted, including mean, standard deviation, coefficient of variation, median absolute deviation (MAD) and interquartile range (IQR). All the features are combined and the dimension of the combined feature vector is reduced by the principal component analysis (PCA).

The occurrence of seizure ranges from a short interval to several hours. Electroencephalogram (EEG) is the most suited tool to diagnose epilepsy. However, currently, neurologists do a manual observation of EEG to diagnose epilepsy and related disorders. Manual observation is a tiresome task and can result in fatigue-related errors in the diagnosis. An EEG based automated diagnosis system is a useful tool in such cases. In this paper, we propose a unique method to classify EEG signals into two classes viz. Seizure and non-seizure using signal Ensemble Empirical Mode Decomposition (EEMD) and Least Squares Support Vector Machine (LSSVM). In this system, EEG signals are decimated using EEMD algorithm. To progress the diagnosis accuracy when compared to human involvement, the LSSVM classifier classifies the signals. The proposed EEMD method is the improved version of EMD attempts to answer the mode-mixing problem of EMD. The feature set comprises of centered correntropy (CenCorrEn) values of decomposed signals. The LSSVM classifier is efficient for this problem as it solves linear equations instead of a quadratic programming problem.

Epilepsy is marked by intermittent seizures, the detection of which can be a challenging problem. Therefore, reliably detecting the onset of seizures has evoked the interest of researchers over the last few years. Major leaps in the domain of machine learning, signal processing methods, and computational capabilities have made it a tractable task. In this paper, we apply multi-resolution dynamic mode decomposition (MRDMD), which is a data-driven dimensionality reduction technique, on the problem of epileptic seizure detection. This method can effectively separate a complex non-linear system into a collection of time-scale components at different resolutions. We have applied this algorithm on two different scalp EEG datasets, i.e., CHB-MIT and KU Leaven datasets. We have applied necessary post-processing steps to reduce the false alarm rate and boost the sensitivity and specificity. A detailed analysis of the results has been presented for the proposed method applied to both the datasets. The algorithm achieves a sensitivity of 0.937 and 0.96, a specificity of 0.99 and 0.99, a false alarm rate of 0.587 and 0.413 per hour, and a latency of 3.12 and 2.75 s for CHB-MIT and KU Leuven, respectively.

EEG waveforms are composed of distinct bands of frequencies. Most of the researchers have used a wide range of frequencies or every frequency band of EEG for detection process of epileptic seizures to obtain high accuracy. However, not all frequency bins contain relevant information about seizures, thereby degrading the performance of the detection system. This paper demonstrates the suitability of only delta band (0.5–4 Hz) for the detection of seizures due to epilepsy. The work has been performed in four stages: (1) Short-time Fourier transform (STFT) of EEG data, (2) extraction of delta band from the time–frequency (t–f) plane, (3) calculation of four statistical features (4) performance analysis using Random Forest (RF) classifier. The proposed methodology achieved an average accuracy, specificity and sensitivity of 99.6%, 99.5% and 99.67% respectively between persons suffering from epilepsy and healthy people on Bonn EEG dataset.

In this study, a new method was proposed to automatically detect and classify epileptic seizures from EEG (Electroencephalography) signals. Methods: In the proposed method, EEG signals classification five-classes including the cases of eyes open, eyes closed, healthy, from the tumor region, an epileptic seizure, has been carried out by using the support vector machine (SVM) and the normalization methods comprising the z-score, minimum-maximum, and MAD normalizations. To classify the EEG signals, the support vector machine classifiers having different kernel functions, including Linear, Cubic, and Medium Gaussian, have been used. In order to evaluate the performance of the proposed hybrid models, the confusion matrix, ROC curves, and classification accuracy have been used. The used SVM models are Linear SVM, Cubic SVM, and Medium Gaussian SVM. Results: Without the normalizations, the obtained classification accuracies are 76.90%, 82.40%, and 81.70% using Linear SVM, Cubic SVM, and Medium Gaussian SVM, respectively. After applying the z-score normalization to the multi-class EEG signals dataset, the obtained classification accuracies are 77.10%, 82.30%, and 81.70% using Linear SVM, Cubic SVM, and Medium Gaussian SVM, respectively. With the minimum-maximum normalization, the obtained classification accuracies are 77.20%, 82.40%, and 81.50% using Linear SVM, Cubic SVM, and Medium Gaussian SVM, respectively. Moreover, finally, after applying the MAD normalization to the multi-class EEG signals dataset, the obtained classification accuracies are 76.70%, 82.50%, and 81.40% using Linear SVM, Cubic SVM, and Medium Gaussian SVM, respectively.

EEG data of all channels of each patient are segmented into four second segment lengths, and these segments are decomposed using discrete wavelet transform into four frequency bands corresponding to the δ θ α and β EEG rhythms. Three features are then extracted from each of these bands, which are used to classify the seizure and non-seizure segments. The proposed approach does not require any feature processing, or any post-processing for obtaining the seizure detection results. The CHB-MIT database with data of 23 pediatric patients is used for validation of the proposed seizure detection approach using five classifiers, and accuracy, sensitivity and specificity values of 99.6%, 99.8% and 99.6% respectively, averaged over all 23 patients, are obtained using five-fold cross-validation method. The obtained seizure detection results are compared with the results of other studies using the same database, and shown to out-perform the state-of-the-art. Furthermore, the obtained results are consistent over the data of all the patients, thereby demonstrating the robustness of the approach. The computational efficiency of the proposed approach, which is another highlight of the approach, is also illustrated in the form of metrics. The suitability of the approach for seizure detection in long-term multi-channel EEG recordings is also discussed. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bspc.2018.07.006,10.1016/j.bspc.2018.07.006,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85050465702&doi=10.1016%2fj.bspc.2018.07.006&partnerID=40&md5=59a09e9101c96e6543fc29954a629633,2018,28/03/2024 1:15,28/03/2024 1:15,,157-165,,,46,,Biomed.

EEG signals are nonstationary in nature and show abnormal neural activity during the ictal period. Seizures can be identified by analyzing and obtaining features of EEG signal that can detect these abnormal activities. The present work proposes a novel morphological feature extraction technique based on the local binary pattern (LBP) operator. LBP provides a unique decimal value to a sample point by weighing the binary outcomes after thresholding the neighboring samples with the present sample point. These LBP values assist in capturing the rising and falling edges of the EEG signal, thus providing a morphologically featured discriminating pattern for epilepsy detection. In the present work, the variability in the LBP values is measured by calculating the sum of absolute difference of the consecutive LBP values. Interquartile range is calculated over the preprocessed EEG signal to provide dispersion measure in the signal. For classification purpose, K-nearest neighbor classifier is used, and the performance is evaluated on 896.9 hours of data from CHB-MIT continuous EEG database. Mean accuracy of 99.7% and mean specificity of 99.8% is obtained with average false detection rate of 0.47/h and sensitivity of 99.2% for 136 seizures. © EEG and Clinical Neuroscience Society (ECNS) 2017.",https://doi.org/10.1177/1550059417744890,10.1177/1550059417744890,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85042115596&doi=10.1177%2f1550059417744890&partnerID=40&md5=e9856c3db848b120940a38c44d73d641,2018,28/03/2024 1:15,28/03/2024 1:15,,351-362,,5,49,,Clin.

Sys. Comput.,21945357 (ISSN); 978-981131609-8 (ISBN),,"Epilepsy is a brain disorder, characterized by transitory and impulsive electrical signal of the brain. The electroencephalogram (EEG)-based seizure detection system used for automated diagnosis of epilepsy requires optimum classification of signals. This paper presents an optimized method for classification as normal and epileptic signals using Empirical-Mode Decomposition (EMD) technique. The Intrinsic-Mode Functions (IMFs) are few symmetric and band-limited signals obtained by applying EMD to the signals. However, optimum selection of IMF features is crucial step in deciding feature set for classification. The 95% confidence ellipse area is calculated from the Second-Order Difference Plot (SODP) of selected IMFs to form features for classification. The feature space is used by the Cosine Similarity Measure Support Vector Machine (CSM-SVM) classifier with optimum feature selection. It is observed that the features formed using ellipse area of dissimilar combination of IMFs have given superior classification performance on EEG data available from the Bonn University, Germany. © 2019, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.",https://doi.org/10.1007/978-981-13-1610-4_9,10.1007/978-981-13-1610-4_9,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85054830455&doi=10.1007%2f978-981-13-1610-4_9&partnerID=40&md5=51a0af57c49f67d2623139ad6ef1e8a6,2019,28/03/2024 1:15,28/03/2024 1:15,,87-96,,,828,,,,,,,,Springer Verlag,,English,,,Scopus,,,,,"<p>ASReview_relevant</p>; <p>Export Date: 13 February 2024; Cited By: 2; Correspondence Address: D.A.

Phys. Conf. Ser.,17426588 (ISSN),,"One of the most common brain disorders is epilepsy. A person who has epilepsy is not able to have normal days like the others. It's characterized by more than two unprovoked seizures. However, the faster detection and treatment of epileptic seizures, the quicker reduction of the disease abnormal level. Neurologists are still diagnosing, detecting, and testing a seizure manually by observing the Electroencephalogram (EEG) signals. This takes a very long time because of the irregularity of EEG signals. Hence, a Computer-Aided Diagnosis (CAD) is developed by many scientists to help neurologists in detecting seizures automatically. In this research, a CAD system was developed at CHB-MIT dataset. The EEG signals were processed at several stages through this system, namely pre-processing, decomposition, feature extraction, and classification. In pre-processing, the EEG signals were uniformed by selecting the most appropriate channels and filtered using Butterworth Bandpass Filter (BPF) to remove noise. The process continued to the decomposition and feature extraction stage using Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD) and fractal dimension-based methods, i.e. Higuchi, Katz, and Sevcik, respectively. Then, the features were classified by Support Vector Machine (SVM). The proposed method achieved the highest accuracy at 94.72% on the Chb07 record. Meanwhile, the average accuracy was 81.2% for all records. The proposed study is expected to be applied for the detection of seizure onset in a real-time system.  © 2021 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",https://doi.org/10.1088/1742-6596/1844/1/012019,10.1088/1742-6596/1844/1/012019,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85103541854&doi=10.1088%2f1742-6596%2f1844%2f1%2f012019&partnerID=40&md5=b1bb4a6b27cde8adfd00aca05081d192,2021,28/03/2024 1:15,28/03/2024 1:15,,,,,1844,,,,,,,,IOP Publishing Ltd,,English,,,Scopus,,,,,"<p>ASReview_relevant</p>; <p>Export Date: 13 February 2024; Cited By: 8; Conference name: 2020 2nd International Conference on Science and Technology, ICoST 2020; Conference code: 168066</p>",,,Bandpass filter (BPF); Bandpass filters; Biomedical signal processing; Brain disorders; Butterworth filters; Computer aided diagnosis; Computer Aided Diagnosis(CAD); Electroencephalogram signals; Electroencephalography; Empirical Mode Decomposition; Epileptic seizure detection; Epileptic seizures; Extraction; Feature extraction; Feature extraction methods; Fractal dimension; Interactive computer systems; Neurophysiology; Real time systems; Support vector machines,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Journal of Physics: Conference Series,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,yes,,,,Include,,,Machine Learning,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Pratyasha,An Intelligent Approach to Detect Epileptic Seizure,2019 International Conference on Intelligent Sustainable Systems (ICISS),,,"Epileptic seizure is a disorder of brain activity, usually characterized by the recurrent discharge from the cortex of cerebrum which leads from vigorous shaking of limbs to physical injury like arching of spinal cord, stroke etc. However instead of monitoring the patient for long duration, we need an intelligent technique for the accurate detection of seizure with less consumption of time. Hence this work focuses on a hybrid computational intelligence technique for the analysis of Electroencephalogram (EEG) signal to detect epileptic seizure by taking the EEG scalp data of ten patients from an open source (CHB-MIT) and converting these collected data into signal for the accurate seizure detection. Thereafter four spectral features i.e energy, entropy, mean and standard deviation have been extracted from the EEG signal by an efficient feature extraction method such as Discrete Wavelet transform (DWT) followed by Genetic Algorithm (GA) based feature selection technique to remove redundant features for more estimable accuracy. Later on, the selected features are grouped into training and test data sets. Finally, these selected sets are classified by a robust classifier namely, Support Vector Machine (SVM) for the accurate detection of epileptic seizure. In the end, the accuracy of classified features before feature selection is compared with classified features after feature selection. From the simulation results it has been found that DWT with GA based feature selection technique enhances the seizure detection accuracy as compared to DWT detection method.",https://doi.org/10.1109/ISS1.2019.8908069,10.1109/ISS1.2019.8908069,,21/02/2019,28/03/2024 1:15,28/03/2024 1:15,,45-50,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,<p>ASReview_relevant</p>,,,Discrete Wavelet Transform; Discrete wavelet transforms; Electroencephalogram; Electroencephalography; Epileptic seizure; Feature extraction; Genetic Algorithm; Scalp; Support Vector Machine; Support vector machines; Training,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2019 International Conference on Intelligent Sustainable Systems (ICISS),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,yes,,,,Include,,,Hybrid Model,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this paper, new algorithm is proposed to detect the seizure through a short period only 10 seconds. Eleven features are extracted from EEG signal to characterize behavior of EEG activities.

However, the existing techniques use single-channel EEGs from public databases and the sample size is small. OBJECTIVE: This study proposes a strategy to distinguish multichannel EEGs for health control, particularly the interictal and ictal multichannel EEGs of epileptic patients. METHOD: We calculated five features (variance, Pearson correlation coefficient, Hoeffding's D measure, Shannon entropy, inter-quartile range), which are based on maximal overlap discrete wavelet transform. These features were then fed into linear discriminant analysis for classification purposes. Finally, the proposed method was tested on data on 34 healthy people, 21 interictal patients and 30 ictal patients taken from a hospital. RESULTS: Our experimental results show that the accuracy between healthy and epileptic seizures was 96.88% and the area under the curve (AUC) is 1. The accuracy between interictal and epileptic seizures was 94.12% and the AUC was 0.97. We also obtained an accuracy and AUC equal to 1 for discrimination of interictal EEGs from normal. Finally, we obtained an AUC of 0.83 and an accuracy of 85.88% for discrimination in these three classes. Therefore, our study achieves sufficient performance. CONCLUSIONS: Our proposed method can serve as an auxiliary tool for clinicians who wish to make clinical decisions and reduces the burden of detecting epileptic seizures. © 2020 - IOS Press and the authors.

However, verification of an atypical epileptic seizure often can only be done through long-term EEG monitoring for 24 hours or longer. Hence, automatic EEG signal analysis for clinical screening is necessary for the diagnosis of epilepsy. We propose an EEG analysis system of seizure detection, based on a cascade of wavelet-approximate entropy for feature selection, Fisher scores for adaptive feature selection, and support vector machine for feature classification. Performance of the system was tested on open source data, and the overall accuracy reached 99.97%. We further tested the performance of the system on clinical EEG obtained from a clinical EEG laboratory and bedside EEG recordings. The results showed an overall accuracy of 98.73% for routine EEG, and 94.32% for bedside EEG, which verified the high performance and usefulness of such a cascade system for seizure detection. Also, the prediction model, trained by routine EEG, can be successfully generalized to bedside EEG of independent patients. © EEG and Clinical Neuroscience Society (ECNS) 2013.",https://doi.org/10.1177/1550059413483451,10.1177/1550059413483451,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84890112959&doi=10.1177%2f1550059413483451&partnerID=40&md5=f309743888b8576f14b64755dbdfca40,2013,28/03/2024 1:15,28/03/2024 1:15,,247-256,,4,44,,Clin.

Electroencephalography (EEG) is one of the most widely-used measures for the seizure detection and thus has been used in many linear model/deep neural network-based methods. However, those existing EEG-based seizure detection methods have been hindered by limitations such as high latency and/or inconstant seizure detection ability. In this work, we propose an attention-based deep learning algorithm to handle these limitations. Further, the algorithm is learned in an end-to-end manner by combining a seizure EEG representation and a classification stage. To be specific, the proposed network exploits two encoder networks to represent seizure EEG. Then, with the attention mechanism, our network captures temporal interactions from the learned features. Finally, the proposed method efficiently and effectively identifies seizures. We demonstrate the validity of our proposed work by conducting classification of seizures using a publicly available CHB-MIT dataset. Further, we also compare the proposed network to other competitive state-of-the-art methods with an appropriate statistical analysis. Last but not least, we inspect the real-world usability of our method by estimating latency time.",https://doi.org/10.1109/BCI51272.2021.9385307,10.1109/BCI51272.2021.9385307,,22/02/2021,28/03/2024 1:15,28/03/2024 1:15,,1-Apr,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,<p>ASReview_relevant</p>,,,Electroencephalography; Epilepsy; Feature extraction; Deep Learning; Attention; Brain modeling; Classification algorithms; Seizure; Biological neural networks; Convolutional Neural Network; Usability,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2021 9th International Winter Conference on Brain-Computer Interface (BCI),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,yes,,,,Include,,,Deep Learning,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

RQA is adopted since it does not require assumptions about stationarity, length of signal, and noise. The decomposition of the original EEG into its five constituent subbands helps better identification of the dynamical system of EEG signal. This leads to better classification of the database into three groups: Healthy subjects, epileptic subjects during a seizure-free interval (Interictal) and epileptic subjects during a seizure course (Ictal). The proposed algorithm is applied to an epileptic EEG dataset provided by Dr. R. Andrzejak of the Epilepsy Center, University of Bonn, Bonn, Germany.

It can be recorded in a noninvasive manner to present the electrical activity of the brain. The visual inspection of nonlinear and highly complex EEG signals is both costly and time-consuming. Therefore, an effective automatic detection system is needed to assist in the long-term evaluation and treatment of patients. Traditional approaches based on machine learning require feature extraction, while deep learning approaches are time-consuming and require more layers for effective feature learning and processing of complex EEG waveforms. Deep learning-based approaches also have weak generalization ability. This paper proposes a solution based on the combination of convolution neural networks (CNN) and machine learning classifiers. It preprocesses the EEG signal using the Butterworth filter and performs feature extraction using CNN. From the extracted set of features, the approach selects only the relevant features using mutual information-based estimators to reduce the curse of dimensionality and improve classification accuracy. The selected features are then passed as input to different machine learning classifiers. The suggested solution is evaluated on the University of Bonn dataset and CHB-MIT datasets.

Eng.,18761100 (ISSN); 978-981130310-4 (ISBN),,"A neurological condition affecting the central nerve system of people causing recurring seizure is termed as epilepsy or seizure disorder. A seizure can be described as a brief, interim disturbance in the electrical activity of the brain and the cause of its occurrence is the quick firing of many nerve cells in the brain, causing an electrical storm. Almost 50 million people worldwide have epilepsy and its studies often rely on EEG signals for analyzing brains behavior during the occurrence of seizure. Many kinds of research around the world is carried out over past few years to analyze EEG signals automatically to detect epilepsy and type of seizure present. This paper presents classification of EEG signals into healthy/inter-ictal versus ictal EEGs using EMD based fuzzy entropy method and SVM classifier. In EMD, decomposition of the EEG signal from different epileptic states takes place to obtain IMFs. Fuzzy entropy reduces the detection time by reducing the data size of the EEG data without any loss of the information. So here EMD is followed by the calculation of FuzzyEn of the reconstructed signal obtained from IMFs. Finally, feature vectors are formed using fuzzy entropy that are applied to non-linear SVM classifier for classification purpose. The classification accuracies obtained by using proposed method for Z versus S, O versus S, N versus S, and F versus S when only 50% data is applied during testing of the classifier are 99.88%, 99.38%, 98.62%, and 97% respectively. © 2019, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.",https://doi.org/10.1007/978-981-13-0311-1_20,10.1007/978-981-13-0311-1_20,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85049595160&doi=10.1007%2f978-981-13-0311-1_20&partnerID=40&md5=7f5c123e6cb997a28c193d7da4eb3320,2019,28/03/2024 1:15,28/03/2024 1:15,,109-118,,,502,,,,,,,,Springer Verlag,,English,,,Scopus,,,,,"<p>ASReview_relevant</p>; <p>Export Date: 13 February 2024; Cited By: 5; Correspondence Address: N.

Using Hilbert vibration decomposition (HVD) on non-linear and non-stationary EEG signal, we obtain multiple monocomponents varying in terms of amplitude and frequency. After decomposition, we extract features from the monocomponent matrix of the EEG signals. The instantaneous amplitude of the HVD monocomponents varies because of the motion artifacts present in EEG signals. Hence, the acquired statistical features from the instantaneous amplitude help in identifying the epileptic seizures and the normal human activities. The features selected by correlation-based Q-score are classified using an LSTM (Long Short Term Memory) based deep learning model in which the feature-based weight update maximizes the classification accuracy.

Although many classification methods have been applied to classify EEG signals for detection of epilepsy, little attention is paid on accurate epileptic seizure detection methods with comprehensible and transparent interpretation. This study develops a detection framework and focuses on doing a comparative study by applying the four rule-based classifiers, i.e., the decision tree algorithm C4.5, the random forest algorithm (RF), the support vector machine (SVM) based decision tree algorithm (SVM + C4.5) and the SVM based RF algorithm (SVM + RF), to two-group and three-group classification and the most challenging five-group classification on epileptic seizures in EEG signals. The experimental results justify that in addition to high interpretability, RF has the competitive advantage for two-group and three-group classification with the average accuracy of 0.9896 and 0.9600.

We used fully convolutional neural networks to automatically detect seizures.

For these patients, the inclusion of intracranial electrodes together with scalp ones increased the average accuracy and specificity values to 99.6% and 58.3%, respectively.

Eng.,18761100 (ISSN); 978-981190018-1 (ISBN),,"Epilepsy is a life-threatening and challenging neurological disorder which results in a seizure. The seizure makes the functioning of the central nervous system abnormal and the patient ends up with convulsions and a loss of consciousness. Therefore, there is a need for in-depth diagnosis with high accuracy of the disease where electroencephalogram (EEG) signals play a vital role. Spiking neural network (SNN) is used as the classifier to classify EEG-based epileptic seizures. Due to its computational efficiency and biological plausibility, SNN is getting more attention to the classification of time-series data such as EEG signals. Although there are several other classification methods that exist, few of them is able to work with the EEG signals because EEG signals are generally highly variable and noisy. The SpiFoG algorithm is used to train SNN where inputs are encoded in temporal spikes from the feature extracted EEG signals. The dataset used in this research is the Bonn University EEG dataset for the epileptic seizure. From this dataset, three types of epileptic EEG signals are considered. The first is from healthy patients with open eyes, second is from healthy patients with closed eyes, and the third is from patients suffering from a seizure.

An imbalanced learning model is proposed in this paper to improve the identification of seizure events in long-term EEG signals. To better represent the underlying microstructure distributions of EEG signals while preserving the non-stationary nature, discrete wavelet transform (DWT) and uniform 1D-LBP feature extraction procedure are introduced. A learning framework is then designed by the ensemble of weakly trained support vector machines (SVMs). Under-sampling is employed to split the imbalanced seizure and non-seizure samples into multiple balanced subsets where each of them is utilized to train an individual SVM classifier. The weak SVMs are incorporated to build a strong classifier which emphasizes seizure samples and in the meantime analyzing the imbalanced class distribution of EEG data. Final seizure detection results are obtained in a multi-level decision fusion process by considering temporal and frequency factors. The model was validated over two long-term and one short-term public EEG databases. The model achieved a G-mean of 97.14% with respect to epoch-level assessment, an event-level sensitivity of 96.67%, and a false detection rate of 0.86/h on the long-term intracranial database. An epoch-level G-mean of 95.28% and event-level false detection rate of 0.81/h were yielded over the long-term scalp database.

The effectiveness of the IT2FSVM classifier is evaluated based on a set of EEG samples which are collected from 10 patients at Peking university hospital. The EEG samples for the three seizure phases were captured by the 112 2-s 19 channel EEG epochs, where each patient was extracted for each sample. Feature extraction was used to reduce the feature vector of the EEG samples to 45 elements and the EEG samples with the reduced features are used for training the IT2FSVM classifier. The classification results obtained by the IT2FSVM are compared with three traditional classifiers namely Support Vector Machine, k-Nearest Neighbor and naive Bayes. The experimental results show that the IT2FSVM classifier is able to achieve superior learning capabilities with respect to the uncontaminated samples when compared with the three classifiers. In order to validate the level of robustness of the IT2FSVM, the original EEG samples are contaminated with Gaussian white noise at levels of 0.05, 0.1, 0.2 and 0.5. The simulation results show that the IT2FSVM classifier outperforms the traditional classifiers under the original dataset and also shows a high level of robustness when compared to the traditional classifiers with white Gaussian noise applied to it.

The proposed method is based on the application of tunable-Q wavelet transform (TQWT). The long duration scalp EEG signals have been segmented into one-second duration segments using a moving window-based scheme. After that, TQWT has been applied in order to decompose scalp EEG signals segments into multiple sub-band signals of different oscillatory levels. We have generated two-dimensional (2D) reconstructed phase space (RPS) plot of each of the sub-band signals. Further, the central tendency measure (CTM) has been applied in order to measure the area of the 2D-RPS plots. These computed area measures have been used as features for distinguishing seizure and seizure-free EEG signal segments. Finally, we have used a feature-processing technique which clearly discriminates epileptic seizures in the scalp EEG signals. The proposed method may also find application in the online detection of epileptic seizures from intracranial EEG signals. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd 2019.",https://doi.org/10.1007/978-981-13-0923-6_18,10.1007/978-981-13-0923-6_18,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85051920933&doi=10.1007%2f978-981-13-0923-6_18&partnerID=40&md5=f34d70ad47c21d02db06c1c452b3f387,2019,28/03/2024 1:15,28/03/2024 1:15,,209-221,,,748,,,,,,,,Springer Verlag,,English,,,Scopus,,,,,"<p>ASReview_relevant</p>; <p>Export Date: 13 February 2024; Cited By: 12; Correspondence Address: A.

Several improvements in the deep learning methods result in solving the complex problem by end to end learning. However, the current deep learning models have not utilized the EEG data for seizure detection. The main intention of this paper is to develop novel seizure detection in EEG signal using a new feature extraction and classification approaches. The first phase of the proposed model is pre-processing of signal. Further, the combination of Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD) and Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) is performed for the signal decomposition. Then, the feature selection is done by the concatenation of Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA). With this selected features, an enhancement is introduced with the weighted feature selection approach, in which the weight is optimized by the hybrid meta-heuristic algorithm named Jaya-Cat Swarm Optimization (J-CSO).This hybrid meta-heuristic algorithm is easy to implement with no algorithm-specific parameters dependence. It is it easily applicable to real-world optimization problems. Due to these advantages, the performance of the proposed model is superior to the conventional models. Then, the J-CSO-based heuristically Improved Ensemble Learning Model (I-ELM) is introduced in the detection phase, which is proposed by three different classifiers like Fuzzy classifier, Deep Neural Network (DNN), and Long Short Term Memory (LSTM). This is comparable to the accuracy achieved by other contemporary seizure classification approaches, and this approach could serve as an effective tool in the hands of medical practitioners for analyzing bulk data and for speeding up seizure diagnosis. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s41315-022-00233-3,10.1007/s41315-022-00233-3,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85131060959&doi=10.1007%2fs41315-022-00233-3&partnerID=40&md5=fea3fc5fd8394744c5ee0bf484457d60,2022,28/03/2024 1:15,28/03/2024 1:15,,668-693,,4,6,,Int.

Epilepsy affects patients' health and lead to life-threatening situations. Early prediction of epilepsy is highly effective to avoid seizures. Machine Learning algorithms have been used to classify epilepsy from Electroencephalograms (EEG) data. These algorithms exhibited reduced performance when classes are imbalanced. This work presents an integrated machine learning approach for epilepsy detection, which can effectively learn from imbalanced data. This approach utilizes Principal Component Analysis (PCA) at the first stage to extract both high- and low- variant Principal Components (PCs), which are empirically customized for imbalanced data classification. Conventionally, PCA is used for dimension reduction of a dataset leveraging PCs with high variances. In this paper, we propose a model to show that PCs associated with low variances can capture the implicit pattern of minor class of a dataset.

That is why this paper proposed a novel full processing chain of EEG signals analysis for epileptic seizures detection that applied a new alternative approach for EEG rhythms decomposition. EEG signals are decomposed into their different background rhythms using discrete Jacobi polynomial transforms (JPTs) and a 28-dimension feature vector is extracted in frequency and time domains. Due to the high dimension and redundancy of these features, the linear discriminant analysis (LDA) is applied for dimensionality reduction and informative and discriminative low dimension feature vectors are computed and feed as inputs of the support vector machines (SVM) classifiers. The validation of this processing chain is done experimentally using an online available database which consists of five hundred EEG signals. Analysis demonstrated that the EEG rhythms decomposition using JPTs can be implemented as a single-step process and provides more abundant information for class discrimination. In addition, twelve experiments closely related to clinical applications are examined and promising results are achieved with maximum accuracies between 96.25–100 %. Overall, it is found that the proposed processing chain will be useful in providing an accurate and objective scheme for automatic EEG rhythms decomposition and epileptic seizures detection that can be integrated into implantable devices intended to predict the onset of seizures and trigger a focal treatment to block the seizures progression. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bspc.2020.102141,10.1016/j.bspc.2020.102141,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85089669204&doi=10.1016%2fj.bspc.2020.102141&partnerID=40&md5=3bdb781bd3c961e312cf1d3d550089a3,2020,28/03/2024 1:15,28/03/2024 1:15,,,,,62,,Biomed.

In classical approach, EEG signals are first preprocessed to apply signal processing algorithm for feature extraction and then classified for seizure detection. The efficiency of the classifier is highly dependent on the discriminative space, so, the challenge in the proposed approach is to extract features and to apply classifier efficiently so that seizures may be detected well. The two dimensional visual representation of EEG signals (scalogram) obtained through Continuous Wavelet transform is utilized for feature extraction. Local Binary Pattern (LBP) and Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) of instantaneous frequency components of the scalograms are calculated as potential feature values. The extracted features are mapped to discriminative space using various distance metric learning algorithm and mapped features are fed to Support Vector Machine for classification.

Informatics, WMSCI",27710947 (ISSN); 978-195049265-7 (ISBN),,"Epilepsy is one of the most common neurological diseases that affects about 65 million people worldwide. The patient with this disease is usually characterized by recurrent seizures that cannot be predicted at the time of their occurrence and are difficult to deal with, which negatively affects the patient's quality of life. One of the most common ways to diagnose cases of epilepsy is the method adopted to extract information from the signals generated by the electroencephalogram (EEG). Recently, the Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) has been broadly utilized as a time-frequency analysis tool for epileptic EEG signals using computer-aided analysis. However, a few significant issues have not yet been profited from DWT, including epileptic seizure detection systems. Furthermore, in prior studies, the parameters and settings for DWT were chosen indiscriminately or randomly. In this paper, we propose a promising model for epileptic detection based on EEG signals, which integrates DWT, two evolutionary algorithms, and features popularity concept. We divide the EEG signals into their 7 maximum theoretical levels using all wavelet families to give guidance for picking the appropriate DWT settings. Our technique was applied to two separate benchmarked EEG datasets that yielded encouraging results, with accuracy, recall, and f-score of (99.4%) on the UBonn dataset and (100%) on the CHB-MIT dataset. When compared to existing DWT-based techniques used in epileptic EEG analysis, the suggested approach produces highly accurate and robust findings.

As EEG recordings contain a vast amount of data, which is heterogeneous with respect to a time-period, we intend to introduce a clustering technique to discover different groups of data according to similarities or dissimilarities among the patterns. In the proposed methodology, we use K-means clustering for partitioning each category EEG data set (e.g. healthy; epileptic seizure) into several clusters and then extract some representative characteristics from each cluster. Subsequently, we integrate all the features from all the clusters in one feature set and then evaluate that feature set by three well-known machine learning methods: Support Vector Machine (SVM), Naive bayes and Logistic regression. The proposed method is tested by a publicly available benchmark database: ‘Epileptic EEG database’. The experimental results show that the proposed scheme with SVM classifier yields overall accuracy of 100% for classifying healthy vs epileptic seizure signals and outperforms all the recent reported existing methods in the literature.

Ding,Automatic Epileptic Seizures Joint Detection Algorithm Based on Improved Multi-Domain Feature of cEEG and Spike Feature of aEEG,IEEE Access,,2169-3536,"Epilepsy is a disease in which patients undergo seizures caused by brain functionality disorder. Clinically, it is usually diagnosed by experienced clinicians according to continuous electroencephalography (cEEG), which is time consuming even for experienced doctors. Meanwhile, amplitude integrated electroencephalography (aEEG) has shown potential to detect epileptic seizures. Therefore, the paper proposes a hybrid seizure detection algorithm by combining cEEG-based seizure detection algorithm and aEEG-based seizure detection algorithm to detect seizures. In cEEG-based seizure detection algorithm, cEEG signals are divided into 5 s epoch with 4 s overlap and multi-domain features are extracted from each epoch. Then random forest classification is applied to do seizure detection. In aEEG-based seizure detection algorithm, morphological filter is applied to do spike detection and determine whether there are seizures after transforming the cEEG signals into aEEG signals. In order to evaluate the generality of the proposed method, experiments are performed on two independent datasets, including a publicly available EEG dataset (CHB-MIT) and an epileptic dataset collected by using the EEG device developed by the Hangzhou Neuro Science and Technology Co., Ltd. In the CHB-MIT dataset, the accuracy (AC), specificity (SP), sensitivity based on the event (SE), and false positive ratio based on the event (FPRE) obtained by the hybrid method are 99.36%, 82.98%, 99.41%, and 0.57 times/h, respectively. In the dataset we collected, the AC, SP, SE, and FPRE obtained by the hybrid method are 99.23%, 89.47%, 99.23%, and 0.71 times/h, respectively. The experimental results show that the performance of the proposed method is competitive with state-of-the-art methods and results.

In this work, we propose an end-to-end deep neural network called attention-based CNN-BiRNN for automatic seizure detection. Attention-based CNN-BiRNN mainly consists of three parts: the multi-scale convolution model, the attention model, and the multi-stream bidirectional recurrent model. Original signals are firstly sent to the multi-scale convolution model to extract multi-scale features. Then the attention model exploits the differences among channels for seizure detection. Afterwards, the robust temporal features are obtained by the multi-stream bidirectional recurrent model, and are further fed into a fully connected layer for classification. Moreover, a channel dropout method is proposed, for the model training stage, to obtain inconspicuous characteristics from all the channels of a certain EEG signal. The results on the dataset of CHB-MIT demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in terms of both sensitivity and specificity.

However it is still difficult to detect some subtle but critical changes in an EEG signal. In this paper we are designing an automated system (classifier) that classifies the recorded EEG signal into Normal, Interictal and Ictal cases. The automation is achieved by extracting various features that include statistical data in the transformed domain using Wavelet and Hilbert techniques. Also the approximate entropy of the sub-bands are included. Now having known the range of the values, each of the features is given a rank.

For the safety of patients with epilepsy, an automatic seizure detection algorithm for continuous seizure monitoring in daily life is important to reduce risks related to seizures, including sudden unexpected death. Previous researchers applied machine learning to detect seizures with EEG, but the epileptic EEG waveform contains subtle changes that are difficult to identify. Furthermore, the imbalance problem due to the small proportion of ictal events caused poor prediction performance in supervised learning approaches. This study aimed to present a personalized deep learning-based anomaly detection algorithm for seizure monitoring with behind-the-ear electroencephalogram (EEG) signals. Methods: We collected behind-the-ear EEG signals from 16 patients with epilepsy in the hospital and used them to develop and evaluate seizure detection algorithms. We modified the variational autoencoder network to learn the latent representation of normal EEG signals and performed seizure detection by measuring the anomalies in EEG signals using the trained network. To personalize the algorithm, we also proposed a method to calibrate the anomaly score for each patient by comparing the representations in the latent space. Results: Our proposed algorithm showed a sensitivity of 90.4% with a false alarm rate of 0.83 per hour without personal calibration. On the other hand, the one-class support vector machine only showed a sensitivity of 84.6% with a false alarm rate of 2.17 per hour. Furthermore, our proposed model with personal calibration achieved 94.2% sensitivity with a false alarm rate of 0.29 while detecting 49 of 52 ictal events. Conclusions: We proposed a novel seizure detection algorithm with behind-the-ear EEG signals via semi-supervised learning of an anomaly detecting variational autoencoder and personalization method of anomaly scoring by comparing latent representations. Our approach achieved improved seizure detection with high sensitivity and a lower false alarm rate. © 2021",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cmpb.2021.106542,10.1016/j.cmpb.2021.106542,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85119931242&doi=10.1016%2fj.cmpb.2021.106542&partnerID=40&md5=7ff217598c47c819be0f22b93849df0c,2022,28/03/2024 1:15,28/03/2024 1:15,,,,,213,,Comput.

Vucetic,Significant Low-Dimensional Spectral-Temporal Features for Seizure Detection,IEEE Transactions on Neural Systems and Rehabilitation Engineering,,1558-0210,"Absence seizure as a generalized onset seizure, simultaneously spreading seizure to both sides of the brain, involves around ten-second sudden lapses of consciousness. It common occurs in children than adults, which affects living quality even threats lives. Absence seizure can be confused with inattentive attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder since both have similar symptoms, such as inattention and daze. Therefore, it is necessary to detect absence seizure onset. However, seizure onset detection in electroencephalography (EEG) signals is a challenging task due to the non-stereotyped seizure activities as well as their stochastic and non-stationary characteristics in nature. Joint spectral-temporal features are believed to contain sufficient and powerful feature information for absence seizure detection. However, the resulting high-dimensional features involve redundant information and require heavy computational load. Here, we discover significant low-dimensional spectral-temporal features in terms of mean-standard deviation of wavelet transform coefficient (MS-WTC), based on which a novel absence seizure detection framework is developed. The EEG signals are transformed into the spectral-temporal domain, with their low-dimensional features fed into a convolutional neural network. Superior detection performance is achieved on the widely-used benchmark dataset as well as a clinical dataset from the Chinese 301 Hospital. For the former, seven classification tasks were evaluated with the accuracy from 99.8% to 100.0%, while for the latter, the method achieved a mean accuracy of 94.7%, overwhelming other methods with low-dimensional temporal and spectral features.

Since wavelet-based studies were well suited for classification of normal and epileptic seizure EEG, we have applied MODWT which is an improved version of discrete wavelet transform (DWT). The selection of optimal wavelet sub-band and features plays a crucial role to understand the brain dynamics in epileptic patients. Therefore, we have investigated MODWT using four different wavelets, namely Haar, Coif4, Dmey, and Sym4 sub-bands until seven levels. Further, we have explored the potentials of six entropies, namely sigmoid, Shannon, wavelet, Renyi, Tsallis, and Steins unbiased risk estimator (SURE) entropies in each sub-band. The sigmoid entropy extracted from Haar wavelet in sub-band D4 showed the highest accuracy of 98.44% using support vector machine classifier for the EEG collected from Ramaiah Medical College and Hospitals (RMCH). Further, the highest accuracy of 100% and 94.51% was achieved for the University of Bonn (UBonn) and CHB-MIT databases respectively. The findings of the study showed that Haar and Dmey wavelets were found to be computationally economical and expensive respectively. Besides, in terms of dynamic characteristics, MODWT results revealed that the highest energy present in sub-bands D2, D3, and D4 and entropies in those respective sub-bands outperformed other entropies in terms of classification results for RMCH database. Similarly, using all the entropies, sub-bands D5 and D6 outperformed other sub-bands for UBonn and CHB-MIT databases respectively.

Therefore, it is important to detect epileptic seizures and provide medical treatment in a timely manner. Currently, medical experts recognize epileptic seizure activity through the visual inspection of electroencephalographic (EEG) signal recordings of patients based on their experience, which takes much time and effort. In view of this, this paper proposes a one-dimensional convolutional neural network-long short-term memory (1D CNN-LSTM) model for automatic recognition of epileptic seizures through EEG signal analysis. Firstly, the raw EEG signal data are pre-processed and normalized. Then, a 1D convolutional neural network (CNN) is designed to effectively extract the features of the normalized EEG sequence data. In addition, the extracted features are then processed by the LSTM layers in order to further extract the temporal features. After that, the output features are fed into several fully connected layers for final epileptic seizure recognition. The performance of the proposed 1D CNN-LSTM model is verified on the public UCI epileptic seizure recognition data set. Experiments results show that the proposed method achieves high recognition accuracies of 99.39% and 82.00% on the binary and five-class epileptic seizure recognition tasks, respectively.

One of the challenges is to distinguish rhythmic discharges from nonstationary patterns occurring during seizures. The proposed approach is based on an adaptive and localized time-frequency representation of EEG signals by means of rational functions. The corresponding rational discrete short-time Fourier transform (DSTFT) is a novel feature extraction technique for epileptic EEG data. A multilayer perceptron classifier is fed by the coefficients of the rational DSTFT in order to separate seizure epochs from seizure-free epochs.

Epileptic seizures occur irregularly and unpredictably. Its automatic detection in EEG recordings is highly demanding. In this work, multiband features are used to detect seizure with feedforward neural network (FfNN). The EEG signal is segmented into epochs of short duration and each epoch is decomposed into a number of subbands using discrete wavelet transform (DWT). Three features namely ellipse area of second-order difference plot, coefficient of variation and fluctuation index are computed from each subband signal. The features obtained from all subbands are combined to construct the feature vector. The FfNN is trained using the derived feature vector and seizure detection is performed with test data.

Hence, it is of great significance to develop automatic seizure detection technique. Methods: In this work, a seizure detection approach, synthesizing generalized Stockwell transform (GST), singular value decomposition (SVD) and random forest, was proposed. Utilizing GST, the raw EEG was transformed into a time–frequency matrix, then the global and local singular values were extracted by SVD from the holistic and partitioned matrices of GST, respectively. Subsequently, four local parameters were calculated from each vector of local singular values. Finally, the global singular value vectors and local parameters were respectively fed into two random forest classifiers for classification, and the final category of a testing EEG was voted based on sub-labels obtained from the trained classifiers. Results: Four most common but challenging classification tasks of Bonn EEG database were investigated. The highest accuracies of 99.12%, 99.63%, 99.03% and 98.62% were achieved using our presented technique, respectively.

As the EEG signal is highly nonlinear and nonstationary, the traditional Fourier analysis which expands signals in terms of sinusoids cannot appropriately represent the amplitude contribution from each frequency value. The HMS is derived from the empirical mode decomposition (EMD) which decomposes signal into a collection of intrinsic mode functions (IMFs). Since this decomposition is based on the local characteristic time scale of the signal, it can be well applied to nonlinear and nonstationary processes. In this work, the spectral entropies and energy features of frequency-bands of the rhythms using HMS analysis are extracted and fed into the support vector machine (SVM) for seizure detection of EEG signals. A final comparison between the results obtained with the developed technique and results adopted by Polat and coworkers using Fourier analysis with the same database is given to show the effectiveness of this technique for seizure detection.

Discrete wavelet transform (DWT) is an effective method for time-frequency analysis of EEG and has been used for seizure detection in daily healthcare monitoring systems. However, the shift variance, the lack of directionality and the substantial aliasing, limit the effects of DWT in some applications. Dual-tree discrete wavelet transform (DTDWT) can overcome those drawbacks but may increase information redundancy. For classification tasks with small dataset sizes, such redundancy can greatly reduce learning efficiency and model performance. In this work, we proposed a novel redundancy removed DTDWT (RR-DTDWT) framework for automated seizure detection. Energy and modified multi-scale entropy (MMSE) features in a dual tree wavelet domain were extracted to construct a complete picture of mental states. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to employ MMSE as an indicator of epileptic seizures. Moreover, a compact EEG representation can be obtained after removing useless information redundancy (redundancy between wavelet trees, adjacent channels and entropy scales) by a general, auto-weighted feature selection framework via global redundancy minimization (AGRM). Through validation on Bonn and CHB-MIT databases, the proposed RR-DTDWT method can achieve better performance than previous studies. © 2019 by the authors.

In this study, a novel method is proposed for automatic seizure detection in intracranial electroencephalogram (iEEG) recordings based on kernel collaborative representation (KCR). Firstly, the EEG recordings are divided into 4s epochs, and then wavelet decomposition with five scales is performed. After that, detail signals at scales 3, 4 and 5 are selected to be sparsely coded over the training sets using KCR. In KCR, l2-minimization replaces l1-minimization and the sparse coefficients are computed with regularized least square (RLS), and a kernel function is utilized to improve the separability between seizure and nonseizure signals. The reconstructed residuals of each EEG epoch associated with seizure and nonseizure training samples are compared and EEG epochs are categorized as the class that minimizes the reconstructed residual. At last, a multi-decision rule is applied to obtain the final detection decision. In total, 595 h of iEEG recordings from 21 patients with 87 seizures are employed to evaluate the system. The average sensitivity of 94.41%, specificity of 96.97%, and false detection rate of 0.26/h are achieved.

This process is time-consuming, burdensome, reliant on expensive human resources, and subject to error and bias. In epilepsy research, on the other hand, manual detection is unsuitable for handling large data-sets. A computerized seizure identification scheme can eradicate the aforementioned problems, aid clinicians, and benefit epilepsy research. Methods In this work, a new automated epilepsy diagnosis scheme based on Tunable-Q factor wavelet transform (TQWT) and bootstrap aggregating (Bagging) using Electroencephalogram (EEG) signals is proposed. Until now, this is the first time spectral features in the TQWT domain in conjunction with Bagging are employed for epilepsy seizure identification to the best of the authors’ knowledge. At first, we decompose the EEG signal segments into sub-bands using TQWT. We then extract various spectral features from the TQWT sub-bands. The suitability of spectral features in the TQWT domain is established through statistical measures and graphical analyses. Afterwards, Bagging is employed for epileptic seizure classification. The efficacy of Bagging in the proposed detection scheme is also studied in this research. The effects of various TQWT and Bagging parameters are investigated. The optimal choices of these parameters are also determined. The performance of the proposed scheme is studied using a publicly available benchmark EEG database for various classification cases that include inter-ictal (seizure-free interval), ictal (seizure) and healthy; seizure and non-seizure; ictal and inter-ictal; and seizure and healthy. Results In comparison with the state-of-the-art algorithms, the performance of the proposed method is superior in terms of sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy.

This paper presents a three-class classification system based on discrete wavelet transform (DWT) and the nonlinear sparse extreme learning machine (SELM) for epilepsy and epileptic seizure detection. Three-level lifting DWT using Daubechies order 4 wavelet is introduced to decompose EEG signals into delta, theta, alpha, and beta subbands. Considering classification accuracy and computational complexity, the maximum and standard deviation values of each subband are computed to create an eight-dimensional feature vector. After comparing five multiclass SELM strategies, the one-against-one strategy with the highest accuracy is chosen for the three-class classification system. The performance of the designed three-class classification system is tested with publicly available epilepsy dataset. The results show that the system achieves high enough classification accuracy by combining the SELM and DWT and reduces training and testing time by decreasing computational complexity and feature dimension. With excellent classification performance and low computation complexity, this three-class classification system can be utilized for practical epileptic EEG detection, and it offers great potentials for portable automatic epilepsy and seizure detection system in the future hardware implementation. © 2017 Yuanfa Wang et al.",https://doi.org/10.1155/2017/6849360,10.1155/2017/6849360,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85022011493&doi=10.1155%2f2017%2f6849360&partnerID=40&md5=7362924a2e95630ffff7d17b33eed946,2017,28/03/2024 1:15,28/03/2024 1:15,,,,,2017,,Comp.

The proposed method in this paper decomposes EEG signal into set of sub-band signals by applying tunable-Q wavelet transform (TQWT) based filter-bank. The sub-bands in TQWT based filter-bank have different value of quality (Q)-factor and have nearly constant bandwidth (BW). The features are computed by applying cross-information potential (CIP) on Ns number of sub-band signals, for Ns values varying from two to maximum number of sub-band signals obtained from TQWT based filter-bank. The features are computed for various values of Ns and fed as input to random forest (RF) classifier. We have observed that, with the increase in the Ns, the number of computed features increases and hence the classification accuracy (ACC) depends on Ns. In this work, we have obtained ACC of 99 % in the classification of normal, seizure-free, and seizure EEG signals using our proposed method. The developed algorithm is ready to be tested using huge database and can be employed to aid the epileptologists to screen the seizure-free and seizure patients accurately. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s12652-020-01722-8,10.1007/s12652-020-01722-8,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85078768511&doi=10.1007%2fs12652-020-01722-8&partnerID=40&md5=e344d78fca21de20cd2aa5ed658e91de,2020,28/03/2024 1:15,28/03/2024 1:15,,,,,,,J.

Zhang,Classification Epileptic Seizures in EEG Using Time-Frequency Image and Block Texture Features,IEEE Access,,2169-3536,"With the rapid development in technology, computer aided detection or diagnosis has become an indispensable part of the medical industry. Automatic detection of epileptic events is one of the important subjects that have aroused wide interest from more and more investigators. This paper proposes a new model in classification of multi-category electroencephalogram (EEG) signals using time-frequency image and block texture features. The one-dimensional EEG is first mapped to time-frequency domain by means of short-time Fourier transform (STFT), which is adapted to obtain a two-dimensional time-frequency image (2D-TFI). With the idea of multi-scale blocking, the obtained phase images and amplitude images are divided into several sub-blocks corresponding to different frequency ranges and time periods. Then the texture features are calculated to describe the behaviour of EEG signals. Particularly, a novel quadratic feature selection method based on kernel entropy component analysis (KECA) and Kruskal-Wallis test (KW) has been proposed for dimension reduction, by which the features that contained most distinctive information were provided. Eventually, the optimal KECA-based features are fed to support vector machine (SVM) for deciding the class of corresponding EEG. The proposed model is found to achieve at least 99.30% accuracy, 98.0% sensitivity and 100% specificity for each of the eight clinical problems. Our scheme is proven to be effective for seizure detection, which can help doctors optimize the diagnosis workflow, reduce workload and improve detection precision.",https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2960848,10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2960848,,2020,28/03/2024 1:15,28/03/2024 1:15,,9770-9781,,,8,,IEEE Access,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,<p>ASReview_relevant</p>,,,EEG; Electroencephalography; Epilepsy; Support vector machines; Feature extraction; Brain modeling; Entropy; Time-frequency analysis; Seizure; kernel entropy component analysis; multi-scale blocking; quadratic feature selection; texture features; two-dimensional time-frequency image,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,yes,,,,Include,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This paper presents a novel analysis system for detecting epileptic seizure from EEG signals, which uses statistical features based on optimum allocation technique (OAT) with logistic model trees (LMT). The analysis involves applying the OAT to select representative EEG signals that reflect the entire database. Then, some statistical features are extracted from these EEG signals and the obtained feature set is fed into the LMT classification model to detect epileptic seizure. To test the consistency of the proposed method, all experiments are carried out on a benchmark EEG dataset and repeated twenty times with the same parameters in the detection process, and the average values of the performance parameters are reported. The results show very high detection performances for each class, and also confirm the consistency of the proposed method in the repeating process.

Characterizing electroencephalogram (EEG) signals of the patient is an effective way for the early prediction of epileptic seizures. In this paper, a new method called the entropy of visibility heights of hierarchical neighbors (EVHHN) is proposed to detect seizures from the EEG signals. First, the visibility relationships of three nearest neighbors are determined by a visibility criterion. Then, we compute the visibility heights of three nearest neighbors for each data point. Next, the four different kinds of entropy associated with neighbor visibility states are calculated to characterize the EEG signals and finally these features are validated by LS-SVM classifiers. In the experiment, the normal and ictal EEG signals are classified with the accuracy of 99.6%, meanwhile, the interictal and ictal EEG signals are distinguished with the accuracy of 98.35%, which proves the effectiveness of our proposed method. Notably, the computational time of extracting features for each set is 1.751 s, which is largely reduced compared with other weighted visibility graph-based methods. In conclusion, the EVHHN can potentially be an effective method for characterizing complicated EEG signals and real-time detection of epileptic seizures.",https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2890895,10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2890895,,2019,28/03/2024 1:15,28/03/2024 1:15,,7889-7896,,,7,,IEEE Access,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,<p>ASReview_relevant</p>,,,Electroencephalography; Epilepsy; Feature extraction; Frequency-domain analysis; entropy; Entropy; electroencephalogram (EEG); Transforms; Bars; hierarchical neighbors; visibility height,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,yes,,,,Include,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epilepsy can lead to sudden tumble and loss of awareness or consciousness, disturbances of movements. Fortunately, epilepsy seizures can be controlled if epilepsy is detected and treated properly. One of the widely used methods for detecting and diagnosing epilepsy is monitoring and analyzing electroencephalogram (EEG) signals. However, the traditional methods of monitoring and analyzing EEG have some challenges such as high costs, requirements of experienced medical experts, non-scalability, or non-support real-time and long-term monitoring. Therefore, in this paper, we present an advanced deep learning neural network approach for the automatic detection of epilepsy seizures. The proposed approach with a customized attention mechanism can be used for a single EEG channel. We evaluate the approach with the Bonn dataset and the CHB-MIT dataset and achieved higher than 98% accuracy, 99% sensitivity, and 98% specificity for a single EEG channel in most of the cases.

The proposed method is based on the empirical mode decomposition (EMD) and the second-order difference plot (SODP). The EMD method decomposes an EEG signal into a set of symmetric and band-limited signals termed as intrinsic mode functions (IMFs). The SODP of IMFs provides elliptical structure. The 95% confidence ellipse area measured from the SODP of IMFs has been used as a feature in order to discriminate seizure-free EEG signals from the epileptic seizure EEG signals. The feature space obtained from the ellipse area parameters of two IMFs has been used for classification of ictal and seizure-free EEG signals using the artificial neural network (ANN) classifier. It has been shown that the feature space formed using ellipse area parameters of first and second IMFs has given good classification performance.

If so, seizure detection could benefit from convolutional neural networks because their visual recognition ability is comparable to that of humans. We explored image-based seizure detection by applying convolutional neural networks to long-term EEG that included epileptic seizures. After filtering, EEG data were divided into short segments based on a given time window and converted into plot EEG images, each of which was classified by convolutional neural networks as ‘seizure’ or ‘non-seizure’. These resultant labels were then used to design a clinically practical index for seizure detection. The best true positive rate was obtained using a 1-s time window. The median true positive rate of convolutional neural networks labelling by seconds was 74%, which was higher than that of commercially available seizure detection software (20% by BESA and 31% by Persyst). For practical use, the median of detected seizure rate by minutes was 100% by convolutional neural networks, which was higher than the 73.3% by BESA and 81.7% by Persyst. The false alarm of convolutional neural networks’ seizure detection was issued at 0.2 per hour, which appears acceptable for clinical practice. Moreover, we demonstrated that seizure detection improved when training was performed using EEG patterns similar to those of testing data, suggesting that adding a variety of seizure patterns to the training dataset will improve our method. Thus, artificial visual recognition by convolutional neural networks allows for seizure detection, which otherwise currently relies on skillful visual inspection by expert epileptologists during clinical diagnosis. © 2019 The Authors",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.nicl.2019.101684,10.1016/j.nicl.2019.101684,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85060708570&doi=10.1016%2fj.nicl.2019.101684&partnerID=40&md5=e252b3aafc24b60713a7b5e1be70636a,2019,28/03/2024 1:15,28/03/2024 1:15,,,,,22,,NeuroImage Clin.,,,,,,,,English,,,Scopus,,,,,"<p>ASReview_relevant</p>; <p>Export Date: 13 February 2024; Cited By: 111; Correspondence Address: H.

Our model combines a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and a Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BLSTM) network to efficiently mine information from the EEG data using a small number of trainable parameters. Specifically, the CNN learns a latent encoding for each one second window of raw multichannel EEG data. In conjunction, the BLSTM learns the temporal evolution of seizure presentations given the CNN encodings. The combination of these architectures allows our model to capture both the short time scale EEG features indicative of seizure activity as well as the long term correlations in seizure presentations. Unlike most prior work in seizure detection, we mimic an in-patient monitoring setting through a leave-one-patient-out cross validation procedure, attaining an average seizure detection sensitivity of 0.91 across all patients. This strategy verifies that our model can generalize to new patients. We demonstrate that our CNN–BLSTM outperforms both conventional feature extraction methods and state-of-the-art deep learning approaches that rely on larger and more complex network architectures. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bspc.2020.102360,10.1016/j.bspc.2020.102360,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85096650624&doi=10.1016%2fj.bspc.2020.102360&partnerID=40&md5=2c3eb91a9dbf537e1726713028624349,2021,28/03/2024 1:15,28/03/2024 1:15,,,,,64,,Biomed.

Firstly, various features in temporal, spectral, and temporal-spectral domains are extracted from Electroencephalogram (EEG) signals. Afterward, a Correlation analysis via the Pearson Correlation Coefficient (PCC) is conducted on the extracted features to select and remove highly correlated features. It leads to the second feature set with about half numbers of the first feature set. Next, three separate filter-type feature selection techniques, including Relief-F (RF), Compensation Distance Evaluation Technique (CDET), and Fisher Score (FS), are conducted to this second feature set for ranking features. Following that, a feature fusion is engaged by the DSET through the individual feature ranking results to generate high qualified feature sets. Indeed, the DSET-based feature fusion is devoted to enhancing the feature selection confidence using the least superb ranked features. In the classification stage, an Ensemble Decision Tree (EDT) classifier, along with two common validation procedures, including hold out and 10-fold cross-validation, is appropriated to classify the selected features from the EEG signals as normal, pre-ictal (epileptic background), and ictal (epileptic seizure) classes. Finally, several test scenarios are investigated using experimental data of Bonn University to evaluate the proposed ESD performance. Moreover, a comparison with other research works on the same dataset and classes is accomplished. The obtained results indicate the effectiveness of the proposed feature fusion approach and superior accuracy compared to the traditional methods.",https://doi.org/10.1109/JSEN.2020.3026032,10.1109/JSEN.2020.3026032,,1/02/2021,28/03/2024 1:15,28/03/2024 1:15,,3533-3543,,3,21,,,,,,,,,,English,,,,WOS:000607394400093,,,,<p>ASReview_relevant</p>; Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;32<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;33<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;56,,,Electroencephalography; Epilepsy; feature selection; Feature extraction; Brain modeling; Entropy; Sensors; PCA; electroencephalogram (EEG) signals; FEATURE-EXTRACTION; CLASSIFICATION; PREDICTION; WAVELET TRANSFORM; ALGORITHMS; AUTOMATED DIAGNOSIS; Electrostatic discharges; ensemble-based classifier; Epileptic seizure detection (ESD); fusion approaches,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,yes,,,,Include,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The detectors rely on a common spatial pattern (CSP)-based feature enhancement stage that increases the variance between seizure and nonseizure scalp electroencephalography (EEG). The proposed feature enhancement stage enables better discrimination between seizure and nonseizure features. The first detector adopts a conventional classification stage using a support vector machine (SVM) that feeds the energy features extracted from different subbands to an SVM for seizure onset detection. The second detector uses logical operators to pool SVM seizure onset detections made independently across different EEG spectral bands. The proposed detectors exhibit an improved performance, with respect to sensitivity and detection latency, compared with the state-of-the-art detectors. Experimental results have demonstrated that the first detector achieves a sensitivity of 95.2%, detection latency of 6.43. s, and false alarm rate of 0.59. per. hour. The second detector achieves a sensitivity of 100%, detection latency of 7.28. s, and false alarm rate of 1.2. per hour for the MAJORITY fusion method. © 2015 Elsevier Inc..",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.yebeh.2015.06.002,10.1016/j.yebeh.2015.06.002,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84934293104&doi=10.1016%2fj.yebeh.2015.06.002&partnerID=40&md5=8dd1ee587e69425a578db34e2a8aa444,2015,28/03/2024 1:15,28/03/2024 1:15,,77-87,,,50,,Epilepsy Behav.,,,,,,,,English,,,Scopus,,,,,<p>ASReview_relevant</p>; <p>Export Date: 13 February 2024; Cited By: 29; CODEN: EBPEA</p>,,,EEG; signal processing; Electroencephalography; Article; electroencephalography; human; algorithm; clinical article; epilepsy; sensitivity analysis; sensitivity and specificity; controlled study; Algorithms; Epilepsy; Humans; Seizures; support vector machine; pathophysiology; procedures; mathematical analysis; Seizure onset detection; time factor; Time Factors; electrography; Common spatial pattern; methodology; standards; limit of detection; analytical equipment; common spatial pattern enhanced electroencephalography feature; epileptic seizure onset detector; nomenclature,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,yes,,,,Include,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Finding traces of epilepsy through the visual marking of long Electroencephalogram (EEG) recordings by human experts is a very tedious, time-consuming and high-cost task. It is always a challenging issue for the researchers and neurologist to automatically detect epilepsy disorder from EEG signals which contains huge fluctuating information about the functional behavior of the brain. The Complex network-based time-series analysis approach has the ability to perfectly describe the principal dynamics of the EEG signals. By considering this fact, this paper aims to propose a graph theory based innovative framework and a new complex network feature that is efficient for the automated classification of EEG signals to detect epilepsy. In this study, we introduce a new method for the mapping of time series EEG signals to complex network. We also develop a new feature, named as “Edge Weight Fluctuation (EWF)” that helps to extract sudden fluctuation in EEG signals. The proposed scheme is tested on two benchmark Epileptic EEG databases (Bern-Barcelona EEG database and Bonn University EEG database). In order to check the validity of our proposed methodology, we perform simulation analysis with two different chaotic signals named as Henon map and Logistic map. We also performed the One-Way ANOVA statistical test. The overall accuracy has achieved 99% for Bern-Barcelona database and 100% for Bonn University database. The experimental results reveal that our proposed methodology is more efficient to distinguish epileptic seizure signal from between diverse EEG signals. © 2021",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apacoust.2021.108098,10.1016/j.apacoust.2021.108098,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85107414714&doi=10.1016%2fj.apacoust.2021.108098&partnerID=40&md5=c2f132a39b363958ab8f8c255c85e367,2021,28/03/2024 1:15,28/03/2024 1:15,,,,,180,,Appl Acoust,,,,,,,,English,,,Scopus,,,,,"<p>ASReview_relevant</p>; <p>Export Date: 13 February 2024; Cited By: 13; Correspondence Address: S.
